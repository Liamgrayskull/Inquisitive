(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n##

Grass and foliage colors will change throughout the year, and in the winter, temperatures will shift and allow for snow to fall in some biomes that don't normally receive any. Seasons also affect various other features, like crop growth, weather, and more!\n\n## Info and Terms\n\n### Requires [![GlitchCore Icon](https://i.imgur.com/zC7XoOh.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/glitchcore) [GlitchCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/glitchcore) for Minecraft 1.20.4 and above!

Unlike other copper mods, we have added exciting new features to copper that complement its existing properties and give it a unique role. One significant change we made is replacing stone with copper for all redstone components. This opens up exciting possibilities for future additions, like the Toggler and the Headlight. Additionally, we have introduced many new building blocks that work well with copper and made building with copper easier by adding features like patina scraping and wax indication.\n\n![the lil seperation line](https://i.imgur.com/ySyLyUr.png)\n## 📺 Showcase:\n\n \n\n \n### [⚙️General Changes⚙️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWsqtIdCmpg&t)\nThis video introduces the addition of Copper Nuggets and the ability to get Patina from scraping copper blocks.\n\n### [🏮🕹️ Redstone Components 🕹️🏮](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F2mOxHxAhE)\nThis video showcases this mod's changes to redstone components, mainly how it changes that those components that are made of cobblestone in vanilla minecraft get now made with copper. These can also by oxidized, not naturally, but only by manually right clicking them with patina. With this you can more easily distinguish each line of redstone and cause less chaos while doing redstone contraptions. \n\n### [🏛️🧱 Building Blocks 🧱🏛️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB20k-q2Y0U)\nThis video showcases this mods additions to building blocks.\n\n### [♨️ Compatibility ♨️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aY2wKHylSk)\nThis video showcases compatibility with other mods\n\n### [🐝Wax Indication🍯](https://youtu.be/asX2nCUF1Os)\nIn this video, we showcase how you can see the particles around blocks that are waxed when you hold up a honeycomb.\n\n### [🪨Prismarine Crafting🪨](https://youtu.be/JCvca3Xc1jk)\nIn this video, we showcase how in Copperative you can craft Prismarine Shards and Prismarine Crystals out of Patina and some other items.\n\n### [📟💎 Toggler 💎📟](https://youtu.be/uwduY6QP4e4)\nCopperative's new exclusive redstone component!

This display is also now used in the inventory, as it's way more compact and allows for many more effects to be shown before they start to overlap. And this new inventory display is no longer limited to the player inventory, now you can see your active effects in every container!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But wait, now that status effects are shown small and compact with just an icon, how will you find out how your active effects are called? Don't worry, a handy tooltip is added for that. The tooltip will be even more useful when <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-effect-descriptions-jeed\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Just Enough Effect Descriptions</strong></span></a> by <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mehvahdjukaar\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MehVahdJukaar</strong></span></a> is installed.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You like the vanilla inventory status effect display and want to keep it or even use it on the hud as well? No problem! You can choose any widget mode you want, or even none. Alongside that there are many configurable settings, such as the screen side for effects, amount of rows and columns, a custom alpha value, text colors, custom screen positions, and much, much more.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/askYVd2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/288/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/290/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Stylish effects in action being very stylish</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Various effect render types can be chosen and configured</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/291/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/292/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Compact effects replace the vanilla display inside of the inventory</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>The effects display is shown in every container, not just the inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/293/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/294/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Useful tooltips will appear when effect widgets are hovered</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many possible settings, create your very own effect display</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/295/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Great JEI and REI compatibility</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/askYVd2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Please report it to [mine](https://github.com/CCr4ft3r/CullLessLeavesReforged/issues).  \nPlease do not join their discord or post a comment on their mod page in order to get support for my port. Please post your questions here.\n\nThis port currently does not change any of the original optimizations. On code side the only differences are the following ones:\n\n*   I adapted the class references and mixin injection points to match it to SRG and Forge\n*   I removed one of the original embedded libraries by using the default mixin annotation classes\n*   I removed some compatibility modes for one mod that does not exist for Forge.\n\nThis port is fully compatible with Rubidium/Embeddium* and Oculus. It also should work with Optifine however it will be not officially supported by me.\n\n### **How it works**\n\nInstead of leaving just the outer layer of leaves, Cull Less Leaves also renders a certain amount of layers defined in the config.\n\n* Rubidium for 1.18.2-1.19.2\n* Embeddium starting from 1.20\n\n![comparison](https://i.imgur.com/gicGSgK.png)\n\nRubidium/Embeddium Configuration\n\n![rubidium config](https://i.imgur.com/UbWqA7b.png)","published":"2023-10-29T10:19:20.256396Z","updated":"2023-12-01T13:19:23.851339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":234221,"followers":50,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["wkTY0aKT","prdzLnOo","wPOb8yEG"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qthuEuVy/1eaeef733aa1ad82a38c98c0790cb40f22ea6ef7.png"},"version":{"id":"wPOb8yEG","project_id":"qthuEuVy","author_id":"PiO0ZKEp","featured":false,"name":"Cull Less Leaves Reforged 1.20.1-1.0.5","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.5","changelog":"update to 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-01T13:19:24.453871Z","downloads":156343,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"71b1603071461e036a3ba2aaeeb52cc10fa3d348","sha512":"1d037fd49a9b80eecf2ed8e3b64178d1fbae7cc2a511813ab8b627479713e79a98af0896366e1ad2a3fa3f9849eab086166c1a27227f6d9370c2738132d859e6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qthuEuVy/versions/wPOb8yEG/CullLessLeaves-Reforged-1.20.1-1.0.5.jar","filename":"CullLessLeaves-Reforged-1.20.1-1.0.5.jar","primary":true,"size":22474,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"sk9rgfiA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"pYMej8BZ","user":{"id":"PiO0ZKEp","username":"CCr4ft3r","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118105353?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-26T13:49:54.011703Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"CullLessLeaves-Reforged-1.20.1-1.0.5.jar"},"mods\\servercore-forge-1.5.1+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"06e403ace1c23ab7c6880790622ebcbddc3eed70b7e7f7cc34760d6c5b77e923c162362f133d8d27baa6f78c5869e20562245d06b3b214245192bdbae7040cda","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4WWQxlQP","slug":"servercore","project_type":"mod","team":"vbBUe1OA","title":"ServerCore","description":"A mod that aims to optimize the minecraft server.","body":"# ServerCore\n\n[\n![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/998162243852173402?style=flat&label=Discord&logo=discord&color=7289DA)\n](https://discord.gg/Y9nC7Peq4m)\n[\n![Build Status](https://github.com/Wesley1808/ServerCore/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)\n](https://github.com/Wesley1808/ServerCore/actions)\n[\n![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/servercore?color=00AF5C&label=Modrinth&style=flat&logo=modrinth)\n](https://modrinth.com/mod/servercore)\n[\n![Curseforge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_550579_Downloads.svg)\n](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/servercore)\n\nA mod that aims to optimize the minecraft server.\\\nWorks on both dedicated servers and singleplayer!\n\n#### This includes:\n\n- Several patches & optimizations to improve performance and reduce lagspikes, which shouldn't make any noticeable changes during gameplay.\n\n\n- Several configurable features that can heavily reduce lag, but have a slight impact on gameplay depending on the configuration.\n\n### Warning\n>Some of the above optimizations use algorithms that may alter vanilla mechanics in the slightest.\\\n>These patches should all have an on/off switch in the config. If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n___\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n___\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n___\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n___\n\n#### More configurable mobspawning\n\nAllows you to modify the spawnrate and mobcaps of each individual spawngroup.\nIt also provides optional functionality to force mobcaps to apply to zombie reinforcements, spawners and nether portal randomticks.\n\n___\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n___\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n\n- /servercore reload - Reloads the configuration file.\n\n- /servercore settings - Allows for modifying dynamic settings ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n### Config\n\nBy default, ServerCore will disable most of its changes that can affect vanilla behavior.\\\nThis way you can safely install the mod without having to worry about breaking things.\n\nHowever, if you want to squeeze out the most performance, these default settings might not be enough.\\\nTo change these settings you can edit `config.yml` and `optimizations.yml` in the `config/servercore` folder.\n\nYou can find some example configurations [here](https://github.com/Wesley1808/ServerCore/tree/v1.5.0/docs/config).\n\n## License\n\nServerCore contains several ports based on patches from repositories such as PaperMC, Purpur and Airplane.\\\nIf a file uses the GPL-3.0 license it will be stated at the top.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\n**📘 The official documentation is available at [sinytra.org](https://sinytra.org/docs).**\n\nThe Forgified Fabric API (FFAPI) is a direct port of [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) for the NeoForge\nmodloader, regularly kept up to date with the upstream repository. It is designed to make cross platform mod development\neasier by allowing developers to use Fabric API as a common library to interact with the game's code on both platforms.\nHowever, it is not an abstraction layer, and loader-specific code still needs to be handled separately for each\nplatform.\n\n### 💬 Join the Community\n\nWe have an official [Discord community](https://discord.gg/mamk7z3TKZ) for our projects.

This irritates the cells in human eyes through a short series of acidic chemical reactions, producing an iconic reaction.\n\nThis mod adds the ability to cut onions into slices (rings) to achieve a similar effect! The varying impacts of chopping onions are detailed further in the config.\n\n### Advancements\n- **Cry Me a River:** Make a Ghast shed a tear by cutting onions nearby.\n- **Ninjas Cutting Onions Again...:** While invisible, bring at least ten creatures to tears by cutting onions.\n\n## Config\n\nYou can alter the following:\n- Does cutting onions have any impact at all? (default: **true**)\n  - (Note: setting this to false basically turns this into a mod that just adds two or three foods.)\n- Does peeling Big Onion blocks from [Overweight Farming](https://modrinth.com/mod/overweight-farming) with an axe have the same effect as cutting onions? (default: **true**)\n- Block radius within which blocks/entities are affected\n  - Default: **2**. Must be an integer. Capped at 16 to prevent extreme performance impacts.\n- Does cutting onions cause damage to entities at all? (default: **true**)\n- Chance of making ghasts shed a tear. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.5**)\n- Chance of converting obsidian into crying obsidian. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.25**)\n- Chance of growing nearby weeping vines. Set to 0 to disable (default: **0.75**)\n\n### Tags\nThis mod adds two primary tags:\n- `onion_onion:unaffected_by_onions`: an entity type tag populated with mobs that do not react to onions being cut in their vicinity. Includes skeletons, bosses, and a couple other creatures by default.\n- `onion_onion:onion_proof_helmets`: entities wearing items from this tag on their head do not take onion-related damage. Includes items that cover the eyes, such as the diving helmets from [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create).\n\n- There's also a minor item tag for `motley_mushrooms` to include mushroom items that belong in the motley grill recipe. By default it includes compat with [Spelunkery](https://modrinth.com/mod/spelunkery).\n---\n\n**Requires [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) and [Blueprint](https://modrinth.com/mod/blueprint).**\n\nNote: this mod is *not* affiliated with vectorwing.

CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading.

This effect is immune to some flying and ender mobs (such as Ghast and Shulker).\n\nIn addition, Chorus Milkshake can randomly teleport the drinker and turn the drinker's status effects into an area effect cloud that generates at the original location.\n\nFlavors from <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/enlightend\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enlightend</a>\n-----------------------\n\n![](http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/echoaphaniptera/FUCHSIA_GOO_EN.png)\n\nFuchsia Goo, the strange neutral effect given by Jelly Ring, spreads through mobs via melee attack, protecting the host from almost all damage at the cost of slowing their movement speed. When the duration ends, the host will be ejected vertically.\n\nJust like Chocolate Milkshake, Jelly Ring Milkshake will clear the drinker's beneficial effects. However, it can also heal the drinker based on the number of cleared effects or deal an equal amount of magic damage to undead mobs.\n\n![](http://scpsandboxcn.wdfiles.com/local--files/echoaphaniptera/SPACE_DIVING_EN.png)\n\nThis special effect provided by Zure Berry is only activated when the player takes fall damage, creating a ranged strike around the landing site and saving the player from falling to death if necessary.\n\nZure Berry Milkshake removes the non-beneficial effects of the drinker, but be careful, it will also cause an explosion equal in size to the effects removed.\n\nFlavors from <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/biomesyougo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oh The Biomes You'll Go</a>\n-----------------------\n\n![](http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/echoaphaniptera/EARENDEL_EN.png)\n\nEarendel, the effect provided by Ether Bulb flavor, gives ranged healing to mobs with glowing effects and knockbacks to targets that do not qualify when the surrounding environment's light level is above 7.\n\n![](http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/echoaphaniptera/MORGOTH_EN.png)\n\nMorgoth, the effect provided by Nightshade Berry flavor, causes a ranged magic attack when a weapon is held in the user's main hand and the surrounding environment's light level is below 7.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\n*   For Enlightend - The raw materials of the two flavors provide corresponding effects. Ennegel Pasta and Ender Stew provide Fuchsia Goo and Resonance effects, respectively.\n*   For End's Delight - Most Chorus Fruit foods now provide the Resonance effect.\n*   For Unusual End - Most Chorus Fruit foods now provide the Resonance effect.","published":"2023-05-08T04:57:08.962589Z","updated":"2024-04-29T04:28:51.939909Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":10594,"followers":26,"categories":["food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["Oz3HuoSX","wqkk2J0b","Ao8fe78a","dNuerK7R","3CUMYOXQ","fddUZi8k","eO1BNYJk","EJsEIqkO","dEGe6GxU","uwBPHxFg","qE2iHwVh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/r9DlSEOy/8c9c75427ccae595ccfcd5689f003fb1545dcd58.png"},"version":{"id":"qE2iHwVh","project_id":"r9DlSEOy","author_id":"8LHa8waq","featured":false,"name":"Exquisito-1.20.1-2.0.0","version_number":"2.0.0","changelog":"*

Expect all kinds of critters from small to big now roaming your Minecraft world\n \n## Mod-loader, Version and Config\n\nThis mod is being developed for Fabric and Forge. No backports are planned.\n\nTo modify which animals you can find in your world you can just use a data-pack to edit the respective biome tags that they use to spawn.\n\n# Content\n\n![tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/1c3f237cde7ee85ff0a378c0b4411c75497dc687.png)\n\n### To take a closer look at the features, go to the images section or even look at the wiki!\n**Currently the wiki is wip, but will be updated soon**\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Angler Fish** : \n\nAngler fish spawn in all Deep Oceans, they have unique pathfinding and will always prefer staying near the bottom of bodies of water, making them often found near the ocean depths.\n\n-Angler fish have an emissive layer and custom particles\n\n-Angler fish can be bucketed\n\n-Angler fish cannot withstand the pressure of being on land and will promptly deflate when exposed to air\n\n-When an Angler fish is fed shiny items it will grant the player with `5 minutes of night vision` (these items are contained in a special tag, so they can be edited easily in mod-packs\n\n-Angler fish drop themselves as an item and can be eaten for `5 seconds of night vision`\n\n\n- **Tuna** : \n\nTunas can be found swimming around in Cold Oceans and regular Oceans, both deep and normal. They are the first farmable fish and come with food items and new breeding mechanics.\n\n-Tunas can be bred with fish from a custom tag, once bred they will lay a `Tuna Egg`, a new Armor Stand like entity that will hatch into a baby Tuna\n\n-Tunas are too big to be bucketed, but don't worry, you can transport Tuna Eggs easily with a bucket\n\n-Tunas drop multiple `Tuna Chunks` when killed, which can be cooked, eaten, or turned into a `Tuna Sandwich`\n\n\n- **Seahorse** : \n\nSeahorses are found in Warm Oceans and are the only fish capable of turning its head to look at you!\n\n-Seahorses come in `6 different variants` and when bucketed they display their color with a handy tooltip\n\n-Seahorses are actually capable of clicking and growling, just like in real life\n\n\n- **Snail** : \n\nSnails can be found in Taigas and Old Growth Pine/Spruce Taigas and are quite packed with features\n\n-Snails retreat in their shell when taking damage or when a non shifting player is nearby. When in their shell they are immune to melee damage lower than 12 and cannot move\n\n-You can remove a `Snail's Shell` by shooting a projectile at the Snail while it's not inside its home, the shell can regrow with time\n\n-Snail Shells have 4 main uses: they can be used to turn into bone meal, they can be used to craft `Potted Sweet Berries`, a new block that allows you to collect berries with style while also keeping you safe from their thorns, it can be used in conjunction with other ingredients to create `Escargot` and it can be used as a building material to make some fancy new blocks!\n\n-When Snails get wet, they produce a `Mucus` Trail. This can be triggered by making them stand on wet sponges, mud or getting in contact with water (these blocks can be configured), right clicking them with a bucket of water or exposing them to rain\n\n-Mucus slows down all mobs that aren't Snails and it can be collected to then be either cooked into slime or turned into `Mucus Blocks` a handy new redstone block\n\n-Mucus Blocks slow down entities on contact and solidify when next to water, making players able to walk on them. The solidification of mucus spreads through Mucus Blocks in a circular manner\n\n-With Phantom Membrane Mucus Blocks can be turned into `Ghostly Mucus Blocks`, which work the same way, but when not solidified can be walked through just fine and do not slow the player down\n\n-When Snails are bred they both will lay a clutch of eggs to mimic how Snails are hermaphroditic in real life\n\n\n- **Hamster** : \n\nHamsters can be found in Plains and Meadows and more commonly is Sunflower Fields. The Minecraft Sunflower has been replaced with a new one that now rotates with the sun and can be farmed for `Sunflower Seeds`.\n\n-Sunflower Seeds can be roasted to then be eaten fast like dried kelp\n\n-Hamsters spawn with `4 different variants` and randomly look out for danger by standing on their back feet\n\n-Hamsters can be tamed with Sunflower Seeds, once tamed they can be told to sit and follow like other pets\n\n-Hamsters are very territorial and Hamsters tamed to the same player will try to kill each other\n\n-Hamsters actively collect items and put them in their cheek pouches, once their inventory is full their cheeks will get visually larger\n\n-Players can open their Tamed Hamsters' cheek pouch up and use it as portable storage\n\n\n- **Ant** : \n\nAnts are by far the biggest addition, they spawn in Savannas, Plains and biomes in the `#forest` tag packed inside tiny `Anthill` structures \n\n-Ants have a whole biome dedicated to them called `Ant Gardens`, this biome is full of `Fallen Leaves`, Coarse Dirt, Anthills and `Rotten Trees`\n\n-Ants spawn with randomized Speed, Health and Attack and are neutral, they all attack you if you anger one\n\n-Ants work like Bees and can set their home in Anthills. They also collect resources from Dead Bushes and Tall Grass (configurable with a tag) and bring them back to their home.\n\n-Anthills that have the resource level of 3 randomly turn blocks in a 3x3 radius below them into rotten versions of themselves, consuming all 3 of the resource levels. Logs become `Rotten Logs` and Dirt like blocks become `Ant Mounds`. Anthills come in 3 variants: Anthills, Rotten Log Anthills and Ant Farms. \n\n-Rotten Logs have a new unique woodset not strong enough to craft signs and build boats, but able to be mined faster, you can also obtain a new block by clicking `Rotten Planks` with an axe, `Cracked Rotten Planks`, which produce scary creaky noises when walked on\n\n-Ant Mounds are a new brushable block, when destroyed they anger nearby ants and don’t drop their loot, so make sure to brush it instead! They can be found in `Ant Mounts`, or they can be made by an Anthill, having different loot tables\n\n-Fallen Leaves can be found in Ant Mounds and Ant Gardens and are a new decorative block for your fall themed builds\n\n-`Ant Pupae` can also be found rarely in Ant Mounds, when clicked on the ground they spawn baby `Tamed Ants`\n\n-Tamed Ants work like dogs, they attack any mob you attack and their abdomen can be colored with dyes! Adult Tamed Ants will target other adult Tamed Ants with a different colored abdomen, effectively making you able to set up ant wars\n\n-`Ant Farms` can be crafted with Ant Pupae and are the Beehive alternative to regular Anthills, because they can be collected without silk touch and can be renewably made\n\n-Ant Mounts are a new dungeon structure found in Ant Gardens. They have 4 possible variations and are FULL of Ants and Ant Mounds. The gameplay of the structure consists brushing Ant Mounds and Digging the Packed Mud to get to the other chambers, just be sure not to hit an Ant or break an Ant Mound/Anthill because Ants fight back! This structure has 4 main unique items to find: Ant Pupa, `Crown Pottery Sherd`, `Spade Pottery Sherd` and the `Rot Music Disc`","published":"2023-11-09T23:30:39.563334Z","updated":"2023-11-12T12:05:23.309799Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":271765,"followers":290,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["decoration","food"],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["jGfbbkRl","73LBjQKv","1U2VhIFo","s7b61YnA","RXKJiHaV","Cjjsdx4e"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rex9wwpz/be0be8f4fe41eb5b0aaa2c2885291f36a70aeb9e.png"},"version":{"id":"RXKJiHaV","project_id":"rex9wwpz","author_id":"SRKJvluF","featured":false,"name":"Spawn 1.0.2-forge","version_number":"1.0.2-forge","changelog":"+ Fixed axe stripping issue\n+ Parity Fixes with Fabric","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-11T22:32:49.422961Z","downloads":22736,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4a9ffc09b6bad80bfe21f241bc1f222b4ad7e550","sha512":"624d4d1392e8888d12dc34cc8d4c22e96ad665c4574633877dc1ed6790210a17df12c60ea2f68ffb500cebfc1c419c3c53e12ad9772fd61ce1d23a5c4623bb4a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rex9wwpz/versions/RXKJiHaV/spawn-1.0.2-forge.jar","filename":"spawn-1.0.2-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":7031738,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"QB2dWrFf","user":{"id":"SRKJvluF","username":"Orcinus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/SRKJvluF/6bc2c0d9ba49c8fc01ca93000e8b0696480a55e3.png","bio":"","created":"2021-12-04T03:54:57.699849Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"QB2dWrFf","user":{"id":"Yq8ublDx","username":"bunten","name":"bunten","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Yq8ublDx/d805b85b430281bf8c7aa12a2ded004018b6f519.png","bio":"iam developing\r\n","created":"2020-12-01T23:05:47.969541Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Composer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"QB2dWrFf","user":{"id":"pcavjK69","username":"Ninni","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64173061?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-03T14:55:31.295258Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"spawn-1.0.2-forge.jar"},"mods\\panoramica_forge_1.2.1_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar":{"sha512":"3f77f70d2bfe89aa7487f14f4165a7f216f7a8ab2e5c5237f1e707f4d6754132b56509aedf38327c7498e61c0feaa9eb71c9c44d36932b9bd8e36e74dc116a97","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Panoramica","description":"Panorama Cubes - Now 16% more cuby!\n\nPanoramica © Copyright 2020-2022 Keksuccino.\nPanoramica is licensed under DSMSL (DON'T SNATCH MA STUFF LICENSE).\nSee the mod's GitHub for more information about this license.\n","authors":["Keksuccino"],"version":"1.2.1","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"panoramica_forge_1.2.1_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar"},"mods\\particular-1.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"a858d77246f1da8ba4e32fa61cad935c5366f422db2a1fc6f07bbf1e3c4fb1a44839d240dc7325964ef840f49d51e78ad3068e872b8153234b225bfa25c29d70","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"B1CcCd9h","slug":"particular","project_type":"mod","team":"Mc2Km6ou","title":"Particular ✨","description":"Enhances Minecraft's ambience with hand-crafted visual effects like fireflies, falling leaves, and waterfall cascades","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/orqktjl.png)\n\n## About\n\nParticular is a mod that enhances Minecraft's ambience with many hand-crafted visual effects.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d76cJVT5tHs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

You usually would be forced to restart, even though you didn't really do anything wrong. Maybe\nyour friend didn't do anything wrong either. Overall I believe that death in hardcore is only fun if it feels like you\nreally deserved it, for example while fighting a strong boss monster.\n\nTherefore, this mod aims to solve this problem! When a player dies, instead of being gone for good, they enter a K.O.\nstate, at which point a timer will start running. Being the good friend you are, you can attempt to save them in time.\nIf you do, everything is fine - they get a small debuff and a strong appetite and you two can be on your way again.

This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not.

No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want. And believe it or not, this works with Ender Chests, too!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0ssWwh-owo\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests are so damn useful for storing and transporting many items. But why do you always have to place them on the floor to use them? Time to change that!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In any interface, simply hold shift when hovering the container item and you'll <strong>see all of its contents</strong> in the item tooltip. And if you just quickly want to add a few items, simply <strong>right-click them on the box/chest item in your inventory</strong>. You can do the same without holding an item to <strong>extract items from a box/chest</strong>. To control which item you extract simply use the scrolling wheel to cycle through all the contents. Very useful!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/577/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/578/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Right-click a shulker box item to extract contents stack by stack</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Hold shift to see contents of a shulker box in your inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

I'd really appreciate it if you could comment ones you add so that I could add them to the mod! For a more in-depth tutorial on customization, see the [JEED Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/just-enough-effect-descriptions-jeed).\n \n\n \nFeel free to use this in your modpack!\n \n\nAlso

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

Improvements","description":"Performance improvements for vanilla AI, with  the ability to turn off certain AI behaviors","body":"**Note 1:** If you have performance issues not covered feel free to make a request. \\\n**Note 2:** It is not expected this mod improves performance in all cases. Make sure to test your results to see if you require it.\n\n## About\n\nSimplified AI modification mod focused on performance and low-level modifications to AIs in the game. Picking up the slack for the base game and improving it for a modded ecosystem. Handling common problems such as too many animals, performance hits from swarms of zombies, and simple remove tasks skipped by larger AI improvement mods.\n\n## Story\n\nAI Improvements was born out of the need to improve server performance for large heavily modded servers. As any experienced server owner will know a server's CPU clock time is eaten away by mods all trying to fight over resources. Most server owners and developers will try to attack this problem by trimming mods. Rather than going after the mods installed I started to look at Minecraft itself. Focusing down on how it was designed to work and how it lent to performance problems.\n\nI found that as a server's population grows so does the amount of entities and other resources. At first, I thought \"lets reduce the spawn rate of mobs on the server\" this lead to a complaint about mob farming. Even with testing, it didn't show a major solution to the problem. So rather than taking that approach, I decided to improve how the AI's function. This resulted in a lot of resource and insight into different areas. After many hours, I found my solution and created this mod. \n\n## FAQ \n\n<ins>I installed but didn't see a large gain as promised?</ins>\\\nNewer versions of MC implement fixes for the AI. With the last few versions, the rotation fix was implemented in addition to other fixes. Thus, the impact of this mod is much lower than in older versions.\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the server only?</ins>\\\nYes, the mod is coded to function without it being client side\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the client only?</ins>\\\nYes, though it may not do much to improve fps. \n\n<ins>Where is the config?</ins>\\\n`.minecraft/config/bbm/AI_Improvements.cfg`\n\n<ins>What will happen if I disable the EntityLookHelper replacement?</ins>\\\nYou're not going to see much of an improvement in the AI code. However, if you enabled the other disable configs it should be fine.\n\n<ins>How does this mod work for fixing performance?</ins>\\\nIt depends on the feature and version of Minecraft. Most of the performance comes from caching heavily calculated values. This has the result of reducing CPU time at the cost of an ignorable amount of RAM. See feature list for exacts...\n\n## Current Features:\n\n### Config to disable AI Watch Closest Entity\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. When changed to true it will remove an AI segment called EntityAIWatchClosest. This AI segment handles the coded AIs use to rotate their head towards a nearby entity.Visually this will cause a few odd issues. However, for the CPU this frees up a lot of usage caused by entities. \n\n### Config to disable AI look random, config is not enabled by default\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. Setting the config to true will cause entities to no longer use the 'look idle' AI code. This can improve performance for servers will large populations. As almost every entity on the map will use this when not doing anything important. Visually this can cause the entities head to not rotate sometimes but mostly goes unnoticed.\n\n### Config to replace EntityLookHelper with a more efficient version, config is enabled by default\n\nThis is the main feature of the mod and can greatly improve CPU performance at a small cost to RAM. How this works is MC's look helper code is replaced with a custom version. The custom version stores some data that makes it faster to get the angle for a location. Threw some testing with VisualVM result have shown a 50% to 80% decrease in CPU usage by the AI code. For a server with 25 people on constantly this resulted in a gain from 5 to 7 tps. ","published":"2023-04-16T18:51:48.421272Z","updated":"2024-06-14T06:55:26.483701Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":697020,"followers":130,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.10.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["tSHaOkjT","eJihmpNQ","WfWIqNar","FXloZ58B","1bEvkvYF","Nv6G28rf","LQ8QsY7I","wvt5F0HU","kOyZhvg3","ekt6gf6P","Bh2IA1el","ntR8zSWe","Nk5NP91m","Z2jNP6b2","dGNP90t0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DSVgwcji/819dbaeb9b0dac8250a1403d1db7e7646f9a9b8f.png"},"version":{"id":"eJihmpNQ","project_id":"DSVgwcji","author_id":"j2vvv1qU","featured":true,"name":"1.20.1-0.5.2","version_number":"0.5.2","changelog":"- Update to 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-10T14:33:24.693482Z","downloads":186822,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"11ad483d1fd1f7ebd84b4940b1dc0926b3e9daa8","sha512":"eb932308aceb30f5157e967f1bd4b57eb1a1b2093886cbfaef6524b780337b8b0e2bd41c5103694c3a275827ceb7d63e7c55637a7a46f8e21f0a6770346b757d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DSVgwcji/versions/eJihmpNQ/AI-Improvements-1.20-0.5.2.jar","filename":"AI-Improvements-1.20-0.5.2.jar","primary":true,"size":29553,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"mICmB3NF","user":{"id":"j2vvv1qU","username":"bl4ckscor3","name":"bl4ckscor3","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/j2vvv1qU/a33ac86ccb684d2fb402233151412018699f1c3c.png","bio":"","created":"2021-06-27T09:17:06.110534Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"AI-Improvements-1.20-0.5.2.jar"},"mods\\blocky_siege-6.1.91-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"4a044d13b50d33ad0835a872f9264985b5d9e5a0e8ea26f3fb0bccd5cde34656fc467805500e6ae3048cea3ec0901917a022b6290af649c43a68b20fdee02c07","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Blocky Siege","description":"Adds much more options to raiding and defending with new siege weaponry and golems!","authors":["LuckyOwl, MCreator"],"version":"6.1.91","icon":"C:\\Users\\Liam\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\167d4425de52a14eb48ed4b96fbc63ac99a5da5e.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"blocky_siege-6.1.91-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"a68968e8fab27202f0d2737357511e27282967ced27732cc90d6beaff64cb99359448b7de3e24cdef4e564ecb99ed061ac1e336e07d8ab4771db47bec7c5da45","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"g96Z4WVZ","slug":"badoptimizations","project_type":"mod","team":"8syA22fZ","title":"BadOptimizations","description":"Optimization mod that focuses on things other than rendering","body":"## BadOptimizations\nA collection of mostly micro optimizations that add up to something bigger!\n\n## Wait, what does this even do?\nIt does multiple things:<p>\n\n- **Avoid updating lightmap**<p>\n  Updating lightmap textures are probably the most expensive part of the client tick. During each tick, the client will do some vector math to calculate lightmaps for blocks and the sky, then upload that new texture to the GPU. However, this can be completely avoided and cached if nothing affecting brightness is changed. This mod will cancel lightmap updates if nothing that changes brightness (e.g. gamma slider, potion effects) has changed. \n- **Sky color calculation optimizations**<p>\n  Minecraft uses `CubicScampler.sampleColor` every frame to calculate the current sky color. This function loops 216 times to factor in surrounding biomes-even if all surrounding biomes are identical or have identical sky colors. This mod makes this function only get called if you are between biomes with different sky colors and only makes it get called every tick. Otherwise, a shorter, simpler and faster sky color calculation is used.\n- **Don't do debug logic if we don't need to**<p>\n  Minecraft has four debug renderers that can be activated with a debug server: bees, game events, game test and villager AI. Even if there's nothing to process, the logic for these debug renderers are still executed. This mod will only execute them if debug is enabled and there is data to process.\n\n<p>\nThat's all the major ones, at least.\nYou can disable any optimization in the config file if you need to.\n</p>\n\n## But how much does it help?\n*(tested on my own PC with an RTX 3060, intel i7 12700 and 4GB of allocated ram on Fabulously Optimized)*<p>\nWithout toasts, it goes from 1926-1955 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/523f9117-5dfb-469a-a1e3-2e5c32597057\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 2008-2023 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/a27fcfab-c9ac-4fb0-9dfa-fc2efc61b2f4\" width=\"256\"><p>\nAnd with toasts, it goes from 1351-1384 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/859f710b-036e-4080-9e94-ceaaf5a9bbf9\" width=\"256\"><p>\nTo 1414-1458 FPS:<p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/assets/104597976/5a01d4a7-0789-465d-a08f-aaa54386deb7\" width=\"256\"><p>\n\n## Dependencies?\nNone.\n\n*(Also available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/badoptimizations)!)*","published":"2023-12-03T23:38:30.615171Z","updated":"2024-06-15T06:13:29.544303Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1660920,"followers":621,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["4iRxgKYG","7EtZn21b","LvWnmLrW","CMQm449N","QPNT0tat","ww747oVi","R5epQB48","7mkIryQX","N83O7mRY","tPcndzIs","Rya4Prxg","P1VV7yAB","osrW6S8S","5iiizW8v","NPtJUzCQ","xrCxVWjv","csMggyw8","pYctvKKH","ByJJBuGh","frxUrBuZ","f80P5Er3","ajq5p3Cr","lVUqygYP","6qzarF6r","py5wZc1k","9vTW5SzW","ouYuE0eo","RppoOA91","o0gYJCDi","x9zMt7t7","Tyi2q14M","QFKaP0NG","PY8WFC19","YPx40hkR","WZB4pQ3u","l5RWBdez","yK1K2DcH","pNkHByNm","tfPcVhXP","NepFM2XR","74fRkfKB","PXrqBQZG","O6GYJnvX","vJEBno3y","84AEMPgv","DkQi3drk","KWwNfrjN","wlqlZ5hE","37M8Rd4S","KeVurIPw","8JJc3kIM","r88RTaW8","Go4FoZir","dAVlOLS6","cpFHy43X","bOuSwVyc","aKkny43Y","918aozAU","zLWPzGCh","Gsub2Uuo","ydYsXrGL","eT6Jsaq5","zZYSuJ5b","bpmrr094","lqrDW4fz","V222vBVT","HPufvV6Z","2Aygc6Sx","faqoQF36","QitPsCFU","fPU2qEYo","Yvu9MYgX","YIdCgnz1","LJwG3VNe","eCxTPnVB","iULB5JCQ","FPQdPmAW","xhGlhCut","GydKiUd0","iXgx6zFq","j3hOwXG0","XYBqWKD2"],"icon_url":null},"version":{"id":"GydKiUd0","project_id":"g96Z4WVZ","author_id":"MtdsrsRk","featured":true,"name":"2.1.4 (1.20.1)","version_number":"2.1.4","changelog":"I just can't catch a break can I.  \n- Fix an issue where light/sky colors wouldn't react to time properly  \n\nHOPEFULLY no more critical issues after this-then 1.19 versions won't receive any more updates.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-15T06:00:50.191020Z","downloads":136766,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"29c7689d1c4645a902115e1faa4991c47007b7a5","sha512":"a68968e8fab27202f0d2737357511e27282967ced27732cc90d6beaff64cb99359448b7de3e24cdef4e564ecb99ed061ac1e336e07d8ab4771db47bec7c5da45"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/g96Z4WVZ/versions/GydKiUd0/BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.20.1.jar","filename":"BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":421754,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8syA22fZ","user":{"id":"MtdsrsRk","username":"thosea","name":"Thosea","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/MtdsrsRk/3f5159d38faa7b19426cc1ea6c76036a4e509c18.webp","bio":"@thosea on discord","created":"2023-08-22T16:13:26.975044Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"BadOptimizations-2.1.4-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\exposure-1.20.1-1.7.6-forge.jar":{"sha512":"237fddf3f8daa6c61854d06595a105575577cb1325b7555a3f6082f0c31e6de685a92652e699605e5c9e3f5d10b5df079a28154eae0604f24233fa669c81a4ed","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"hB899VmG","slug":"exposure","project_type":"mod","team":"jIxenIfW","title":"Exposure","description":"Camera mod with focus on process and aesthetics","body":"<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mortuusars/resources/main/media/exposure/main-wide.png\" alt=\"Exposure\" width=1570/><br>\n\n### Expose your film, print your photos!<br><br>\n\n<img  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RM3tuup.png\" alt=\"Camera Description\" width=1000/>\n<img  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pGaIqx4.png\" alt=\"Film, Lightroom and Photograph\" width=1000/>\n<img  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GaTNtKF.png\" alt=\"Photograph and negatives\" width=1000/>\n\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUlfY_wN3MY\" title=\"YouTube Exposure Release Trailer\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

There are times where the mod is getting 50 fps where without it is only 15 fps.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7huyL27_PC8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","published":"2023-12-02T03:11:44.100485Z","updated":"2023-12-02T03:17:05.476053Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":8950,"followers":17,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["fBGV35VM"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjbXWxYV/6cf482858f11f61ac435f5b131aded95cad76b1b.webp"},"version":{"id":"fBGV35VM","project_id":"sjbXWxYV","author_id":"lywbdcMP","featured":false,"name":"Out Of Sight 1.20.1-1.0.3","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.3","changelog":"- Updated to 1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-02T03:17:06.576187Z","downloads":8950,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ce590f533b2b1dd84703a71192221d4db296d51c","sha512":"ca47212adcab4c70f96c848da26799a623cb6d59046ae1fd1bb2cd7d86d978f7cb3f0f2658577e818d4b37ab4c03c11a4c6b23caacbec2b822c98cff7f0c5a97"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/sjbXWxYV/versions/fBGV35VM/out_of_sight-1.20.1-1.0.3.jar","filename":"out_of_sight-1.20.1-1.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":16100,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Uhsckcf4","user":{"id":"lywbdcMP","username":"Corosus","name":"Corosus","avatar_url":null,"bio":null,"created":"2023-11-15T01:51:34.216169Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"out_of_sight-1.20.1-1.0.3.jar"},"mods\\transmog-forge-1.3.0+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"2d8a3f5aa12ac60880663c6559b7f7bbd5761b57483b720cc47f4fdba049ef671778b9e9e1a30bf18d5aecbd08eadf9863ca0c5d6edbeb1df96d744a12b296e5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Th33t82F","slug":"transmog","project_type":"mod","team":"doyxZ4EN","title":"Transmog","description":"Change the appearance of your items without modifying their behavior/stats!","body":"# Transmog\n\nA Minecraft mod to solve the long-standing issue of not looking cool enough.  \nTransmog allows you to change the appearance of items without modifying their behavior at all!  \nIt works on armor, weapons, tools and anything else you can imagine!  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/woiAHnV.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/emVdmtV.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/5if3YW8.png)  \n![](https://i.imgur.com/27uCep2.png)  \n**Fully compatible with items from mods**  \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rr4Hjk0.png)  \n**For more examples, look at the gallery tab!**\n\n# Items & Blocks\n## Void Fragment\nRequired to craft the Transmogrification Table.

The fuel slot. Every Amethyst Shard fills up the power of the Transmogrification Table, and each action will remove one third of it.\n2. The target slot. The item you place in here is the one that will be transmogrified.\n3. The appearance slot. The item you place here will be the one that decides the appearance of the target item and will **not** be consumed in the process.\n## Appearance\nFor most items, the appearance slot will serve as the direct appearance for the target item, the only exceptions to this are:\n* Transmogrified Items. The target item will gain the transmogrification of the existing item, instead of its original appearance.\n* Void Fragments. If you place one of these in the Appearance Slot, the target item will be transmogrified into a hidden item.  \n\nTo remove the transmogrification from an item, place it in the transmogrification table without an appearance item.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

diversifies Piglins by giving unique features to their vanilla variants, as well as adding new Piglin types to fill specific gameplay niches. Along with a few more miscellaneous additions (and lots of content planned for the future), this mod aims to flesh out Piglins and establish their unique identity as a diverse and multifaceted people of the Nether.\n\n## Vanilla Piglin Additions\n<p>Piglin Brutes and Zombified Piglins have been expanded upon!</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/601bd61829436ca76e67be95510f55af8d2a4cda.png\" alt=\"A Piglin Brute charges forward with its Buckler, surrounded by different Zombified Piglin variants.\"/></p>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Zombified Piglin Variants</summary>\n<p>Zombified Piglins now keep the equipment and appearance of the Piglin type they were converted from:</p>\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/eaee84b08008022c00f9fecff987386d466a5d28.png\" alt=\"A Zombified Piglin that was converted from a Piglin Brute - it still has a characteristic golden belt and axe - along with other new Piglin variants in the background\"/>\n    <figcaption><i><p><b>Fig. 1:</b>  This Zombified Piglin was clearly a Brute in its past life.</p></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nEach piglin type has a corresponding zombified piglin variant, and they can spawn naturally as well as being created through zombification. By default, these are:\n- Piglin, holding either a sword or a crossbow\n- Piglin Brute\n- Piglin Alchemist _(new Piglin type from this mod)_\n- Piglin Traveler _(new Piglin type from this mod)_\n\nZombified Piglins can now actually use any ranged weapons they're holding - you don't want to anger them!\n\n### Configuration\nIn the config, you can:\n- Disable this feature entirely- Tweak the spawning chances for Brute, Alchemist and Traveler variants\n### Data Pack\n  - If you want to make a zombified variant for a modded Piglin type, you can use a resource pack to add a new overlay skin under `assets/piglinproliferation/textures/entity/piglin/clothing_[piglinid]`, where `[piglinid]` is the namespaced in-game ID of the modded piglin\n  - If you want them to spawn naturally, make a datapack that modifies `data\\piglinproliferation\\data_maps\\entity_type\\zombified_piglin_variants.json` and follow the format below: \n  - `{\n  \"values\": {\n    \"minecraft:skeleton\": { // the texture file for this would be named \"clothing_skeleton\"\n      \"weight\": 100,\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:diamond_axe\" // spawns with a diamond axe in it's main hand\n        }\n    }\n}`\n  - If you're going to copy and paste this, remove the comments (aka the // fields)\n  - By default, Bygone Nether's Piglin Prisoner and Piglin Hunter have textures in this format and will thus keep their clothing when zombified. They will not spawn naturally unless put in a datapack manually.\n  - Make sure the mob id exists in game before putting it inside the field\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Piglin Brute Changes</summary>\n<p>Piglin Brutes now have a special attack, making them more dangerous than ever before:</p>\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/2c67fb2f135dfe1d112ba2559cbb87e7eefade6e.png\" alt=\"A Piglin Brute charges at the player using the new Buckler shield variant\"/>\n    <figcaption><i><p><b>Fig. 2:</b>  A Piglin Brute charging at the player. If you're not careful around them, they can knock you to your doom...</p></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nInspired by the arm brace on their vanilla texture, Piglin Brutes now carry a **Buckler**, a specialised shield which they use in a new charge attack; they rush towards their enemies at high speed and try to bash into them, dealing massive damage and knockback if they land a hit.\n\nIf you defeat a Brute in combat or raid a Bastion chest, you can get a Buckler of your very own! It lets you charge forward for 0.75 seconds, during which you cannot turn, jump, or be knocked back. Bashing into an entity while charging deals **6-8 Attack Damage** and activates your **Critical Aura** (exclusive to players), which ensures that your next attack is a critical one. However, you can't charge in water - this was implemented to avoid overlap with Riptide Tridents.\n\nFull details can be found in-game by hovering over a Buckler item and pressing **Sneak**:\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/48ad6707c389d5803591ca854d5898ad7b4ec50b.png\" alt=\"The Buckler's Item Description, which shows how it affects the player upon use (i.e. Forward Charge lasts 0.75 seconds, +900% speed, +10 knockback resistance -100% Turning Speed, -100% Jump Strength) as well as what happens when you collide with an entity (i.e. 6-8 Attack Damage, Gain Critical Aura - a new ability which ensures that your next attack will be critical, but is lost if you swing your hand in any way. You cannot charge forward in water.)\" width=400/>\n\n### Enchantments \n\nThe Buckler has exclusive enchantments! Both of these replace Critical Aura with a different, unique ability.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/c516be8fb921ca40339005f31f63473f25559f87.png\" alt=\"An enchanting table/bookshelf setup in the Nether with an enchanted Buckler displayed above.\"/>\n    <figcaption><i><p><b>Fig. 3:</b>  A nether enchanting setup, perfect for the Buckler.</p></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n- **Turning** (Levels I-V): Each level increases your turning speed and charging time but decreases the shield bash's attack damage. At max level, you have complete turn control for 2 seconds but only deal 1-2 damage. _Disables Critical Aura gain after shield bashing._\n- **Bang!** (Levels I-III): Shield bashing creates an explosion instead of a regular attack, which is larger at higher enchantment levels. It deals heavy damage to any entities in the area, but that includes you! It also decreases the Buckler's durability a lot faster than usual, so be careful how you use it... _Disables Critical Aura gain after shield bashing._\n\n### Configuration\nIn the config, you can:\n- Disable this feature entirely by removing the Buckler from Piglin Brutes and Bastions\n- Disable the after image visual effect when an entity charges\n- Tweak the charging times for default and Turning-enchanted bucklers\n- Change the length of the Buckler's cooldown\n- Make the explosion from Bang! destroy blocks as well\n- Let other modded entities use the Buckler\n  - Currently used for Guard Villagers\n  - May not work as intended in every case\n- Enable an experimental feature where Turning-enchanted Bucklers allow you to 'launch' off of blocks you collide with\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/c68a919ba0c6630489bedcafe22a28c0840e2634.gif\" alt=\"Gif of a player using a Turning Buckler to jump off of a block, hitting a Witch when they land.\" width=600/>\n    <figcaption><i><p><b>Fig. 4:</b>  A player uses a Turning Buckler to carry out a surprise attack. _This feature is disabled by default._</p></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</details>\n\n## New Piglin Types\n\n<p>These new Piglins fulfil unique gameplay functions and help spice up the Nether!</p> \n\n![A Piglin, Piglin Alchemist and Pigin Traveler all standing together in the Crimson Forest. The Alchemist is throwing a potion.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/3001db59594bbbf31232703ab3f86af21343fb87.png)\n\n<details>\n<summary>Piglin Alchemist</summary>\n\nPiglin Alchemists can be found in the Nether Wastes, Crimson Forests, and Bastion Remnants. Few know exactly how and when they make their remedies, but there's no mistaking the characteristic clink of their potions! \n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/c28436295dd8ba73747738612dbc53c07766b0f0.png\" alt=\"A lone Piglin Alchemist at the Bastion, pondering its next alchemy project.\"/>\n    <figcaption><i><p><b>Fig. 5:</b>  A lone Piglin Alchemist at the Bastion, pondering its next alchemy project.</p></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThese support-oriented Piglins will see their comrades in trouble and toss them a relevant Splash Potion from their belt:\n- **Potion of Healing/Regeneration** to Piglins below max health\n- **Potion of Fire Resistance** to Piglins on fire\n- **Potion of Strength** to Piglins that are fighting an enemy and below half health\n  - If an Alchemist is nearby, Piglins below half health will now 'retreat' to them for healing\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/ff8c958a6369542c0416d1ac1865398311733dfe.gif\", width=600, alt=\"Video of a Piglin Alchemist throwing a strength potion at a Piglin after it retreats from fighting the player. The Piglin kills the player after it comes back.\"/>\n    <figcaption><i><p><b>Fig. 6:</b>  A Piglin Alchemist buffing its fellow Piglin, helping it to win the battle!</p></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAlchemists also wield a bow, with which they can shoot  Tipped Healing Arrows at their comrades from a long distance. Although they prefer to offer support in battle, they can attack enemies with their bows if need be.\n\nThey can be bartered with just like normal piglins, but they give you a different set of items focused around alchemy and brewing. The loot table can be seen [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ai_FJZJK-uYSkZgQ_xffq9hyVpK4sg?e=EM3Kve):\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/7fb1075afc406919cedad4e4e3803f7c029ee879.png\" alt=\"Table of probabilities for the Piglin Alchemist bartering loot table. If you can't read this, please see the Excel Online link above!\"/>\n\n### Configuration\nIn the config, you can:\n- Tweak the spawn weighting of Alchemists in Bastion Remants\n- Tweak the chance that an item from the Alchemist's belt will be dropped if it's killed\n- Tweak the chance that an Alchemist will get a Tipped Healing Arrow in its belt\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Piglin Traveler</summary>\nWhether in the caverns of the Nether Wastes or in the wretched Soul Sand Valleys, the Piglin Traveler can always be found in their camps waiting for someone to trade with them. \n  \n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/11d95258123964ab82fdf79e1140c782ad6b2f1d.png\",alt=\"Travelers discuss.\"/>\n    <figcaption><i><p><b>Fig. 8:</b>  3 Travelers discuss a nostalgic memory... I wonder what it could be.</p></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nPiglin Travelers have traveled the Nether for many years and have gotten desensitized to the horrors of soul fire and the sight of those who dare not wear gold armor. This means that they won't attack you unless attacked first! \n\nWhen bartering, Piglin Travelers can give out a unique trinket straight from their previous adventures, the Traveler's Compass. This compass is able to point to a random biome or structure, saving you lots of time wandering around! Travelers will also not give out an identical compass pointing to a previously-given biome or structure for the next in-game day, ensuring your inventory isn't filled with repeats.\n\nTravelers are able to still give out items that can help you travel the Nether even without a compass, such items include saddles and warped fungi on a stick. The full loot table can be seen [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ai_FJZJK-uYSkZgQ_xffq9hyVpK4sg?e=EM3Kve):\n\nFor modpack makers, structures and biomes can be added or removed from the Traveler Compass' list of things to search for with the \"traveler_compass_search\" tag via a datapack. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRE67WIn/images/f1d072d1e65af75be01f5f408aed9f7fe6465b1a.png\" alt=\"Table of probabilities for the Piglin Traveler bartering loot table.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2024-08-03T01:05:39.204864Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3698954,"followers":1605,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3","BEeRgTMS","kST7zzvZ","GkLb4bRl","og4A1nN8","FUZo6yCk","g77ke7PC","9fHBXiaj","Q9L2TePN","X2U8ceG9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"og4A1nN8","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.15","version_number":"1.15","changelog":"changed default configs to have quad expansion off\nYou can turn it back on yourself if you want in the configs","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-21T17:21:41.435809Z","downloads":196735,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b46d6b507b12c63a6fa96ca0571c1b94fc6525e48fdfdbcaa018aa3c4a4801da5c4bb80a173f7cca04b1591854147260163716e25041363b8640f20ff1c736d4","sha1":"5bdda0781bf9dfb5f992a7aa2bee64d5d3fe0b84"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/og4A1nN8/modelfix-1.15.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.15.jar","primary":true,"size":45246,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.15.jar"},"mods\\noisium-forge-2.2.2+mc1.20-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"3232c59e8d294faa17292ee1e1bbfdb315b947fb315e03d9ec2e41c18dd36f8f7bc90c95601db872eaf1ddb06f71222d10eb0a377db23d82aaf026ade15f85d0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"KuNKN7d2","slug":"noisium","project_type":"mod","team":"F6SbtU9z","title":"Noisium","description":"Optimises worldgen performance for a better gameplay experience.","body":"![Noisium icon](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/raw/24de632923c03864d65568a2cb5ce1e2cee0a304/docs/assets/icon/icon_128x128.png)\n\n# Noisium\nOptimises worldgen performance for a better gameplay experience.\n\nIn the best case measured so far, the improvements can be up to a 1.25% speedup per thread when generating new chunks in vanilla\nMinecraft.  \nWith 4 threads, that means that there is a 5% increase in world generation speed in total.  \nThis was benchmarked on an Intel i5-7500, on 1.20.1 Fabric with Chunky, by generating a 2000x2000 block area using `/chunky radius 1000`.  \nResults may vary based on hardware and thread counts (e.x. faster hardware may benefit less).\n\n![5 CPU benchmarks, by Uniter, raccoonman2 and ishland](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/raw/08bb4e8884fd2b5615fe74365a27d73c29584c78/docs/benchmarks/5_cpu_benchmarks_by_uniter_raccoonman2_and_ishland.png)\n\nNoisium changes some world generation functions that other mods don't touch, to fill in the gaps left by other performance optimisation\nmods.\nMost notably, `NoiseChunkGenerator#populateNoise` is optimised to speed up block state placement when generating new chunks.  \nSetting the block state via abstractions/built-in functions is bypassed. Instead, the block states are set directly in the palette storage,\nthus bypassing calculations Minecraft does that are normally useful when block states are set, but when generating the world only slow it\ndown. This is a cycle optimisation.  \nThere are also 3 other optimisations, that increase biome population speed, block state sampling speed and chunk unlocking speed (Minecraft\n1.21 and up) during world generation.\n\nNoisium has full 1:1 parity with vanilla worldgen (worldgen without Noisium).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\nNone.\n\n## Compatibility info\n\n### Compatible mods\n\nNoisium should be compatible with most, if not all, of the popular optimisation mods currently on Modrinth/CurseForge for\nMinecraft `1.20.x`, since Noisium aims to fill in the gaps in performance optimisation left by other mods.\nThis includes (but is not limited to) C2ME, Lithium, Nvidium, and Sodium.\n\n- C2ME: every world generation thread runs faster. The biome population multithreading is also done in a much better/more performant way in\n  C2ME, so it's been removed from Noisium since `v1.0.2`. It's suggested to run C2ME alongside Noisium for even better world generation\n  performance.\n- Distant Horizons: Noisium speeds up LOD world generation threads, since LOD generation depends on Minecraft's world generation speed.\n- ReTerraForged: RTF has built-in compatibility with Noisium, to fully utilize the optimisations during RTF world generation.\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nSee the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Acompatibility) for a list of incompatibilities.\n\n## Download\n\n[![GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/github_vector.svg)](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium)\n[![Modrinth](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)\n[![CurseForge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/curseforge_vector.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noisium)\n\n![Fabric](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/fabric_vector.svg)\n![Quilt](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/quilt_vector.svg)\n![Forge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/forge_vector.svg)\n![NeoForge](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/raw/24de632923c03864d65568a2cb5ce1e2cee0a304/docs/assets/badges/compact/supported/neoforge_vector.svg)\n\nSee the version info in the filename for the supported Minecraft versions.  \nMade for the Fabric, Quilt, Forge, and NeoForge modloaders.  \nServer-side.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Q: Will you be backporting this mod to lower Minecraft versions?

Well you came to the right place!\n\nThis Mod serves as an addon to many popular mods and is meant to fill in the gaps by adding all the blocks that such mods add in all wood types currently installed.\n\nEvery block type added is available in ALL wood types.\n\nWith this mod you won't need extra compatibility addons and instead only rely on a single universal one! It's all automatic!\n\nAdditionally the mod will try to convert any block from other uninstalled compat mods into its equivalent ones.\n\n<center>\n\n## 🪑 Supported Blocks🪑\n</center>\n\n![Supported Mods Image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/46dffe3f5006989c79974118b8cabf3558520c61.png)\n\n<center>LEGENDS:</center>\n\n- 1.18.2 - 🟫\n\n- 1.19.2 - 🟦\n\n- 1.20.1 - 🟩\n\n- Only available in FORGE or FABRIC or BOTH - ⬜\n\n- Not available - ❌\n\n<center>\n\n## ❓ F. A. Q. ❓\n</center>\n\nQ: How the heck does this work?\n> A: Magic.\n\nQ: Is this compatible with other compat mods?\n> A: Yes, I've included a list of many popular compat mods. The mod will do its best not to register stuff that's already in them when they are installed\n\nQ: I'm a mod author, could I use this mod to add support to my blocks?\n> A: Yes! The mod includes a very simple and easy to use API with which modders can register an entire block definition in only 10 lines! The mod will automatically generate all assets automatically\n\nQ: Can you add support for \"x\" wood type?\n> A: Go try the mod\n\nQ: A block type isnt supported, can I add it myself?\n> A: Not directly as registration cant be conditional and cant depend on config files. If you are a modder and know code you can make a pull request to the mod or use the EveryCompatAPI class directly in your mods (check their javadocs & mod modules for info)\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!\n\n## Copyright & Licensing\n\nMelody Copyright © 2023 Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

Darkness Mod by GrondagTheBarbarian. \nThe Original Mod can be found here: [https://modrinth.com/mod/true-darkness](https://modrinth.com/mod/true-darkness)\n\nThis was made because the other Fork for Forge 1.20.1 was not Open Source, otherwise this wouldve probably been a Mixin Mod and not a complete Fork.\n\nIf you dont need the Biome Support and dont care about Open Source you should probably pick the other Fork found here because im quite inexperienced with Minecraft Modding and their Version is likely to be better: [https://modrinth.com/mod/true-darkness-forge-updated-fork](https://modrinth.com/mod/true-darkness-forge-updated-fork)\n\n# Biome Support\n\nThis Mod allows you to define biomes in which there should be no True Darkness, or if you so desire invert the behavior and define which biomes should have exlusively True Darkness.\n\n![Specifiy which Biomes you dont want to have True Darkness applied](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/074d0870735b933f8dd921403763070a9f349196.jpeg)\n\nThis mod largely came to be from the \"incompatiblity\" between True Darkness and AlexsCaves, especially the Primordial Caves, which otherwise would be completely dark. However you can also add other biomes like the lush caves to the exclusion list. \n\n# Add your Own Biomes\n\nThe Mod allows any kind of biome to be added so long as they conform to minecrafts standard biome naming. Simply add the biomes to the \"darkness-biomes.json\" which should generate after the first time you open a world.\n\nThis is how a simple config would look:\n> {\"Biomes\":[\"minecraft:lush_caves\",\"alexscaves:primordial_caves\"]}\n\n# Issues\n\nIf you encounter any issues report them on my Github\n","published":"2024-05-31T14:54:14.736507Z","updated":"2024-05-31T15:10:16.705458Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":337,"followers":2,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["xK63wbnY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/c44xmpkF/e00b9798d1a29985b5ad09c466487ce7ce71caf6.png"},"version":{"id":"xK63wbnY","project_id":"c44xmpkF","author_id":"J2aEjyum","featured":false,"name":"True Darkness Biomes 1.0","version_number":"1.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-31T15:10:17.168409Z","downloads":337,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"290cd98b4be50234dbd2f147ef605ab9b4e403ce","sha512":"60cda3c0637fda9c5dafae8aee1c5ddf85857454e4883e0a4980db7c6c66294b2f8e1793afd046f8c85e9a0cc3e9d64ac21eeffc870a4385f0b3f49c0823eb8f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/c44xmpkF/versions/xK63wbnY/darkness-1.20.1-1.0.jar","filename":"darkness-1.20.1-1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":31575,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O6xFDMba","user":{"id":"J2aEjyum","username":"Qsmium","name":"Qsmium","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/J2aEjyum/cbb58701cccc791f49bf4d00e83d504678d6faf8.png","bio":null,"created":"2024-05-31T14:53:08.002992Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"darkness-1.20.1-1.0.jar.disabled"},"mods\\packetfixer-forge-1.4.2-1.19-to-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"5117290f545708d2bed4a79a9225008537d6fae5714a534e3b9c16671f09e384db0db98b312f457f09525b5da87b48ff9e1356885285128fbcd8ec5ba4e6dac5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"c7m1mi73","slug":"packet-fixer","project_type":"mod","team":"3h9GHUuw","title":"Packet Fixer","description":"A simple mod to solve various problems with packets.","body":"# Packet Fixer\n#### Visit my discord server: [Link](https://discord.com/invite/vWBP4P4Yd8)\n\n## Description\nThis mod fixes various package erros.

The mod introduces a number of new dungeons to explore with various sizes and themes, along with a tricky boss to fight at the end of many structures. Obtain the new items to fight through a number of mobs that block your path. Reach the end of the dungeon and defeat the bosses to claim the reward and dungeon for yourself! Welcome to Dungeon Now Loading! Explore and discover, curious dungeoneers!\n\n# Goal\nOur goal is simple: to add 100 new challenging, but fair dungeons and bosses to the world of Minecraft. Minecraft is a sandbox game and players find their own way to enjoy the game, but we believe that there are players that want difficult challenges that demand more skills and knowledge from Minecraft. Our objective is to fill in that gap by adding fun challenges in the shape of dungeons and bosses, while providing more tools that the players can use to face the challenges. We update the mod regularly and every 1% increase in the percentage will be an update that adds in a new structure and boss or a significant update that changes the gameplay of the dungeons. If you are interested in joining our journey to 100%, try out our Dungeon Now Loading Mod!\n\n# \n![Discord](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/78655f8542a976bfbd438a5128706b10f95243e6.webp)\n\nWe have a friendly community in our discord and many activities going on such as:\n\n- Idea Polls\n- Update Announcements\n- Development Sneak Peek\n- Structure Suggestions\n- Checkpoint Player Head Submissions\n- Giving Feedbacks\n- Channels for Sharing Projects\n\nFeel free to stop by: \n\n**Discord Link:** [https://discord.gg/NawU3rgAhE](https://discord.gg/NawU3rgAhE)\n\n#\n![Patreon](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/d34f5f31439550656025a524cb7e51a7e8bc7db1.webp)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B6h6pf0DuMM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWe also have Patreon!

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

New plants called \"springleaves\" are scattered about, which will launch the player at a high velocity depending on the direction of the springleaf. There's also an indigo colored wood-set called and few other decorative plants.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x6kwLkY.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1116\" height=\"473\" /></p>\n<p>A New food source called Bouncer Nuts grow under the indigo tree branches. These will eventually become too heavy and fall off of the tree, breaking open into a few bouncer \"mobs\" which will become squished and dropped as an edible item after about 10 seconds. Squished Bouncers eaten or fed to ringlings, but they cannot be replanted and will only grow off grown indigo trees. Furthermore, another new mob spawns here, called the ringling. The ringling will eat bouncers dropped from nuts or fed by hand from the player. When ringlings are fed bouncers, they become full and will begin digging through the indigo eylium below them, they will occasionally dig up ancient roots and rarely a rooting blade. Ancient roots can be eaten to submerge yourself one block into the ground, it can also be brewed into a rooting potion, which causes this effect for a longer duration. The Rooting Blade will apply that effect on hit for about 3 seconds.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YtHVhRs.png\" width=\"1128\" height=\"555\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">&nbsp;The Enderneath</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The enderneath is an upside down ancient overgrowth, hidden below the end islands and lightly based around radioactivity. Lots of irradium ore generates within the biome and new threats called \"stalkers\" lurk here. Stalkers are very tough mobs, some of the toughest in the game as a matter of fact! They'll try to knock you off the platforms in the enderneath giving you an effect called \"burdened\" in the process, which will greatly increase your falling speed. Furthermore, killing a stalker will cause it to drop stalker its meat and ocassionally its teeth. Stalker meat is a very good food source since the stalker is a challenge to slay, and the stalker teeth can be crafted together with bismuth ingots to make a serrated hook, which has extra range and will bring mobs to your position when attacked.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>glow gourds, azure berries, and cerulean stalk are also found only within this biome. Glow gourds grow down from cerulean vines, and overtime they'll sprout open with fronds off the sides, which allows them to be harvested slices that cause radiation when eaten. Azure berries grow off of lichen-like vines. These berries are very useful as they provide levitation to any player that eats them, letting you save yourself from a fall or escape from the enderneath. Lastly, cerulean stalk can be found here, which is an opposite of bamboo that grows downwards and can be turned into a light blue wood-set.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6VBFhrg.png\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Ooze Seeps</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The ooze seeps is a biome based around ooze and bubbles, with mobs and blocks to fit that theme.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ooze can be found here, which is a new liquid found exclusively in the end. Ooze has many properties such as :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items, projectiles, boats sliding across the ooze surface.</li>\n<li>Most entities will stay completely still and not sink or float while in the liquid.</li>\n<li>You cannot drown in the liquid.</li>\n<li>Going in the liquid applies a new effect called \"enderstride\" which teleports the player to where they are looking randomly.</li>\n<li>Ooze can speed up the growth of some nearby crops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Big gas vents that produce giant bubbles are littered around the biome. They also have different effects depending on what liquid or gas is placed a block below the lowest part.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eleviblooms, a new crop, grows here. Eleviblooms will grow in multiple stages only on chorloam, and when harvested multiple elevibloom berries will begin floating into the air, eventually falling down. Eleviblooms can be eaten to encompass the player in a giant bubble, which can be popped by attacking it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gloops are a new creature which is also found here. Gloops will occasionally harvest grown eleviblooms and then eat the floating berries. If they eat enough of the floating berries they will eventually begin dripping jelly, which at this point allows you to right click them with a bottle and harvest the jelly. Bubble jelly can be eaten for a new effect, \"bubbling\", which will encompass any hit targets in a giant bubble. Furthermore, bubble jelly can he made into a bubble jelly block, which rapidly increases the velocity of whatever entity walks in it to that of the blocks direction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fumesplats also call the ooze seeps home. Fumesplats will occasionally fill up with ooze over time, and then splat the ooze all over its enemies, including the gloop, it's natural enemy. The splat causes a new effect called \"suffocation\". Suffocation will slowly drain the oxygen of any mob who has it, almost like air-drowning. If fumesplats are killed, they can drop a suffocation gland which can be brewed into a suffocation potion.</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FGJWq6E.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1126\" height=\"569\" /><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">The Gaseous Gardens</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>The gaseous gardens is an upper end biome which is based around the noble gases.

In reality, and in this mod, Cloud Storage involves tying a chest, barrel or other inventory to a balloon and sending it up to the cloud. Why? So you can access its inventory from your home, without the need of a complicated network of meteorite-sourced crystals, something you traded with elves through a portal, or even a gigantic chest.\n\n<details>\n<summary>What is this mod exactly?</summary>\n\nThis mod is an easy to use solution to the storage problem. Rather than gating our nearly-endless storage systems behind tech mod stuff or endgame content, most of it can be easily crafted from new items dropped by new mobs that shouldn't be much of a challenge to defeat by most players. Although storage is the main reason you'd play with this mod, there is additional content added such as new foods, pets, blocks, mechanics, music disc etc. that are all thoroughly polished and fit the theme and aesthetic of both the mod and Minecraft itself.\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Getting Started</summary>\n\nIf you get confused by such a simple mod or don't want this website constantly open in the other tab, I'd recommend you craft the in-game guide book:\n\n\n![in game guide book recipe](https://i.imgur.com/nU4JUOE.png)\n\nThis book is written by yours truly and should be a better guide than this mod description. But if you insist...\n\nThe first major addition of cloud storage are two mobs that drop the main materials required to create balloons, cloud chests, etc. Meet the Badloon and the Bloviator.\n![Badloon and Bloviator](https://i.imgur.com/cUFQCIm.png)\nBadloons are angry, yet fragile balloon monsters that attempt to punch you with their single glove, in hopes of knocking you off to your doom. However, they can be easily popped with any projectile and are deathly afraid of cactus. Badloons drop 0-2 balloon pieces when killed.\n\nBloviators are hostile cloud spirits that will attempt to spew gusts of wind at you to push you away - although this does no damage in itself, it is quite a nuisance. But if the weather turns from clear skies to rain, the bloviator will enter its charged, thundercloud form, zapping you with lightning instead. When killed, big bloviators split into smaller ones, just like slimes. The smallest ones have a chance of dropping a Cloud Block, and the thunder-y ones can drop a Static Cloud Block.\n\nBoth of these monsters only spawn at y-level 196 and above (spawning is highly configurable), so you will have to climb high into the sky to find them. Once you have enough of their respective drops, you're going to need to craft at least two balloons and one cloud chest, like so:\n![balloon and cloud chest recipe](https://i.imgur.com/ojv52TM.png)\n\nThen, simply dye the balloons any color of your choosing(or don't, I'm a mod author, not a cop) and tie one to a normal chest under the sky to send it to the cloud. Once the chest has reached world height and been uploaded to the cloud, you should be able to access all of its 27 slots by placing the balloon of the same color inside the cloud chest. Note that this only works if the cloud chest has skylight access! When you need more space, simply tie another balloon of the same color to a chest and send it upwards. By default, cloud chests can hold up to 4096 slots (configurable of course) - which is a lot of items.\n\n![Cloud Chest interface](https://i.imgur.com/zncmMfX.gif)\n\nCloud chests can be scrolled through, sorted, and searched in order to find any item you need.\n\nCloud chests themselves are private storage - like an ender chest, they are exclusive to you and cannot be opened by other players, or accessed by hoppers. Luckily, if you need something like that, there is the static cloud chest, made in the same way as the cloud chest but with static cloud blocks. These can be accessed by hoppers, pipes, other players, etc. as they are static and the same for everyone. To upload to the static inventory, you will need a statically-charged balloon, which you can get by rubbing a balloon against a static cloud.\n\nSince static cloud chests can be accessed from anywhere by hoppers, they can be used as instantaneous item transport beyond two far points, such as two separate bases, or a sky mob farm.\n\nBalloons have other uses too, such as slowing your fall speed and reducing fall damage, and can be tied to fences and stands for decoration. Cloud blocks also can be used to reduce fall height.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Additional Fun Content</summary>\n\nAn additional new mob is added, the Balloon Buddy, who can be crafted and will be your best friend forever and ever. They have 8 possible personalities which dictate how they behave, fight, etc.\n\nIn villages, you can find the Balloon Salesman, who can trade you a variety of cloud storage - related items, along with his own propeller hat. Sometimes, they can offer a map to a temple in the sky or a big balloon, which has a unique loot chest and mob spawner (1.18.2 only)\n\nCotton candy is a new food source that can be crafted from sugar and cloud blocks. It's fun to eat but I'm not a fan of the taste.\n\nYou can use some of the bottled clouds to create a new tool called the Cloud Blower. But I don't understand how you could possibly have fun with one of those oversized hairdryers...\n\nIf a badloon is popped by a skeleton, it can drop a unique new music disc.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Credits</summary>\n \n- Yosh: Art assets\n- FallenReaper: Art assets\n- Carro1001: Art assets\n- Crydigo: Art assets\n- Shroomy: Music disc\n- PlummetStudios: testing\n- Alex's Mods Discord <3\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Future/Possible Additions</summary>\n \n\n\n- ~~Cloud structures~~  Added in 1.1.0\n\n- Cloud Crafting\n\n- Cloud Golems to facilitate cloud crafting\n\n- Enough balloons being able to lift multi-blocks a la Up\n\n- More Balloon Buddy personalities\n\n- Creative mode only cloud chests/amenities for server admins\n\n</details>\n\nFollow the development of this project and my other mods on:\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexModGuy)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/alexsmods)\n\nAnd report any sort of bugs or issues [here](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/CloudStorage/issues).","published":"2023-11-04T18:41:34.797966Z","updated":"2023-11-04T18:50:03.872185Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":7335,"followers":47,"categories":["mobs","storage"],"additional_categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["RdcFsm0S","KZArKVbj","oBl3wMLG","atLwSfh7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZiATPR3I/8b779c8ebbde098d72b640d45c7f522d3f7aa58f.png"},"version":{"id":"RdcFsm0S","project_id":"ZiATPR3I","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Cloud Storage 1.4.0","version_number":"1.4.0","changelog":"-Updated to 1.20/1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-04T18:48:48.195712Z","downloads":6141,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"408d4d54297a957bcb15547233bc26156a0376ddd539830b791d43fdd6a8014b26a206ff5f7f45b7ec712c73b96d5b2a521ee72b65c84310d49c7b15e0b47b14","sha1":"583d797ade4d5b4e8de5f0171957cf6b2f691d8d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZiATPR3I/versions/RdcFsm0S/cloudstorage-1.4.0-1.20.jar","filename":"cloudstorage-1.4.0-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":2118989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"jJfV67b1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"R9z07ATT","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"cloudstorage-1.4.0-1.20.jar.disabled"},"mods\\modmenu-7.2.2.jar":{"sha512":"9a7837e04bb34376611b207a3b20e5fe1c82a4822b42929d5b410809ec4b88ff3cac8821c4568f880775bafa3c079dfc7800f8471356a4046248b12607e855eb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"mOgUt4GM","slug":"modmenu","project_type":"mod","team":"VMz4FpgB","title":"Mod Menu","description":"Adds a mod menu to view the list of mods you have installed.","body":"# Mod Menu\n![Screenshot of the Mods screen, showing a list of a few mods on the left side below a search bar and filters button, where Mod Menu is selected. On the right side of the screen, it shows more details about the mod, such as authors, a description, links, credits, and a button to configure the mod.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/images/155dd2b006883b168b1279ec0ff21e753946518b.png)\n\nMod Menu lets you view the mods you have installed and, if supported by the mod, enables quick and easy access to the mod's config screens.\n\nMod Menu also supports some more advanced features, such as translatable mod names and descriptions, support for [QuickText formatting](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/) in mod descriptions thanks to [Patbox](https://ko-fi.com/patbox)'s [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api), filters library mods out from regular mods, a mod update checker for mods hosted on Modrinth or that provide their own update sources, and deep configuration for all the features we provide.\n\n### Supported Platforms\nMod Menu is currently available for Fabric or Quilt on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14 or newer.\n\n## Developers\nMod Menu includes a number of APIs for developers to improve how their mod appears in Mod Menu. These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>","published":"2020-11-06T05:11:04.725058Z","updated":"2024-06-21T14:44:42.928177Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":11206167,"followers":11030,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.4","1.16.5","21w06a","21w14a","1.17-pre1","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w15a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w05a","23w07a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4-pre2","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4-pre4","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4-rc2","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w42a","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21","1.21.1-rc1","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M3KFXLhq","DgzrfgAZ","O90fUm3q","zC13OZD9","7QWIhei3","79rtoAM6","kBofQyu4","TleLdS1A","PqgXyy3N","Mnl0OeFI","pxj9L3Vy","6YvLIUDN","wb5nbuL5","bPE0GIoY","pqlMITZQ","RIf7gcLA","Gz5wa6j2","EDbIonje","wRE7Emzz","mzVbb1XI","bHODZExo","a8bewBQT","NyFB1gry","oQr5VO7q","u955lyFM","E4QBMVtO","c6uDXZX8","bojzkt4w","4Ar2wg0k","G8sCBZ1X","JyL5b75a","GOPQZTVp","Wr4GfZdy","tlM0eBmY","DOitjZ89","XtL1i60M","VaZTuVan","FMqdptUn","aH8qgnVM","9xECQHnM","LVxVja5i","JOqf8AZn","WKj0jgYj","jZQ0G78K","PN4NcBa1","WkUCkcQA","3CD6YUw1","JPP6w2U1","eueI9czw","4JrWqhWw","Ui2loaCY","fw5MM4c4","6f25OJ7w","E4VKK6kQ","y8cYdaYa","GYRoFp1I","Tk7mCRX1","aShj7736","dP3zrFbp","cx9D94fU","pnFEFiHq","ybXxCvz4","NsD1IoUs","oU5qfeR6","2Ys0a7JE","8TOgNwQL","kQDE01D3","3umfHb6R","Gbkn1raO","d86kV6wd","NAs8eiQa","RxrqnH1z","GI1HTA1O","sI3kiPZE","4dReZoTJ","7mdkE3Od","qDXCbEz4","IPLgxPn7","V4hnfgRO","nVxObSbX","7kh2ofyR","eIrlBn1Z","yA8g3pEj","oqeCO757","4LXaG2xg","5qqTBb38","7E8dbVv0","5aw4r6fS","pyDmgV07","jRqFAHRH","4EOA40rU","gSoPJyVn","RtaGQNyd","sXVmzBDB","U31K6311","JYTmttex","pged5sGx","5e62j63G","nM5QaZNo","aMxXwo9x","3gwnUSKz","yjjsLqbS","RdCGzY7B","EuNUYds8","iZRiOnnj","M7LIgtWJ","RTFDnTKf","CtMNOUcV","zv46i3PW","VHzvWfY2","sLzitH81","id0aLmxO","eTCL1uh8","lMqXEzUw","jbNN4rAs","lEkperf6","sMAXpy0X","TwfjidT5","qpKaDJtd","Edgke5GX","tXEHCONL","4EYB2Bxx","fCQyI9Zj","sjtVVlsA","ua8KrvY4","mtTzRMV2","w3icASIi","VOHp29AO","ybV7vGT5","NgnZx44E","9FL4cmP7","KXx8jdVE","YLesFuAc","I7OSH8Gw","jnj30PDT","HLa8flfl","FawTQg29","lJ1xXMce","xhN1IvHi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/1b6bcdef5a3d92572f517122650716be7ec6458b.webp"},"version":{"id":"lEkperf6","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","author_id":"Dc7EYhxG","featured":false,"name":"v7.2.2

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

Backpacks","description":"A Backpack mod where Aesthetics meet Functionality. Overhauls Minecraft's inventory with one simple-to-use feature.","body":"Opening your inventory you'll find the new **Back Slot**. After equipping your Backpack, you can store items placing items ontop of it and display it on your back for other players to see.\nBackpacks holding items cannot be taken off unless you place it into the world using **Sprint + RClick**. Interact with the backpack to see the items inside or **Sprint + RClick** agian to re-equip!\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">Show Your True Colors! </h1>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img src=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/blob/20.1/assets/images/banners/customize_backpacks.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Customize Backpacks\">\nChoose from a variety of new backpacks to clean up your inventory. Leather Backpacks can be dyed any color you can imagine, just like it's armor. Metal Backpacks can be trimmed in a smithing table or used with a Upgrade Template to convert it to a larger and fireproof Netherite Backpack. Ender Backpacks hold a global inventory unique to the player who crafted or trimmed it, and other players can access that inventory if you make extras.\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">Fill 'er up! </h1>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img src=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/blob/20.1/assets/images/banners/play_with_friends.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Play With Friends\">\nNew items are automatically put into the top of the backpack. Hovering over the backpack you\nhave equipped previews the items you have inside. If you need to get the chapstick \nthat might've fallen to the bottom, ask your friend to help out and grab it for you. \nDouble-check your diamonds after they've been in there though.\n</p>\n\n<h3> Inventory Controls</h3>\n\nInsert or take items just by clicking **directly onto** the equipped backpack. To help move you items around use your **Sprint Key + Click** as if you were shift clicking items into any other inventory. This key can be bound to something different in the settings. You can press **Sprint Key + Right Click** on a block to quickly place your backpack and access all of your items. \n\n<h1 align=\"center\">More than Meets the Eye! </h1>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/blob/20.1/assets/images/banners/other_wearables.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Other Wearables\">\nDecorated Pots and Cauldrons can also be equipped. Pots can store 128 stacks of a single kind of item. Cauldrons hold 24 buckets of any fluid. These types of wearables are too heavy to be placed and can only be taken off by emptying them first.\n\n<h3> On Death</h3>\n\nYour items will stay safely where you died inside a backpack dropped at your feet. Pots and Cauldrons will drop as an item that can only be picked up with an empty Back Slot. (Hurry Back!)\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">Let's See You Move! </h1>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/blob/20.1/assets/images/banners/special_backpacks.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Special Backpacks\">\nWinged Backpacks allow you to use your elytra with a backpack and Ender Backpacks are bound to a player when crafted or re-trimmed. Unlike Ender Chests, their inventory is unique to that bound player. Share a Ender Backpack with a friend to remotely send items to one another.\n\n<h3> Redstone Components</h3>\n\nUse Hoppers and Comparators to create complex loaders and contraptions with your backpacks. Using Ender Backpacks can be a means for long ranged redstone or to simply send items back to your base when you no longer need them.\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">Looking for More? </h1>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/blob/20.1/assets/images/banners/adding_backpacks.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Adding Backpacks\">\nStill not enough? That's up to you! You can add as many backpacks as you'd like with properties you decide through Data and Resouce Packs. Read through <a href=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/wiki/Custom-Backpacks\">Custom Backpacks</a> from the wiki to add your own backpack.\n</p>\n\n<h3> Mod Packs</h3>\n\nIf you are using this mod in a mod pack I would love to hear your feedback! If you need to change any config, check out [Configurations](https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/wiki/Configurations) from the wiki for a how-to. There it outlines how to use datapacks to make items disable the backslot, or to blacklist items from the Backpack Inventory.\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">Feedback </h1>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/blob/20.1/assets/images/banners/feedback.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Giving Feedback\">I'm curious how you play with my mod! If you have any suggestions or changes <a href=\"https://github.com/BeansGalaxy/Beans-Backpacks-2/discussions/categories/feedback\">create a new discussion here</a>.

Not only does it completely overhaul the boring old Minecraft Villages with tons of heavily detailed houses to explore, but it integrates Supplementaries/Quark decorations and Create mod doors, puzzles, traps, and over 30 other mods. I got sick of installing structure mods into a pack and roaming the world, only to find vanilla items and nothing of difficulty anywhere. I love detailed builds and Create machines, so I decided to make mods that adds exactly what I’ve been missing. Beautiful and challenging dungeons and structures packed with lore that are fully integrated into multiple core mods.\n\nCheck out my other mods!\n- Integrated Stronghold\n- Integrated Dungeons and Structures (IDAS)\n\n## Configuration and optional Integration\n\n<details>\n<summary>Spoiler</summary>\nBy default IV disables vanilla villages from spawning, you can change this in the config file.\n\nTo configure anything else, download this [https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/integrated-villages-configuration](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/integrated-villages-configuration)\n\nTo change spawn rates change the spacing and separation in the structures sets. Spacing is the Average distance between two neighboring generation attempts. Value between 0 and 4096\nSeparation is the Minimum distance in chunks between two neighboring attempts. Value between 0 and 4096. Can't be bigger than spacing\n\nTo edit biomes, edit the biome files in tags/worldgen/biome/has structure\n\nTo disable structures, remove the structures from the structure set file\n\nTo improve compatibility with other structure mods, add structure SETS to the “structure set to avoid” list in each of the tags/worldgen/structure_set files\n\nConfiguration for what workstations appear from mods you have installed will be coming soon!\n\n</details>\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n<details>\n<summary>Spoiler</summary>\nQ: What biome mods are compatible?\nA: Most biome mods are compatible and integrated including Terralith, BOP, and Regions Unexplored.\n\nQ: Will you backport/update to ___?\nA: I will always keep the mod up to date with the newest versions of Minecraft as the dependencies update. It is very unlikely but not impossible for me to do a backport.\n\nQ: Does this mod work with other structures mods?\nA: Yes all of Yung's mods, Repurposed Structures and more will all work with zero issues. \n\n\nQ: Can I use this mod in a modpack?\nA: Yes! I would love it if this mod gets used in packs.\n \n\nQ: Can this mod be only on the server-side?\nA: No, due to its custom music discs and soundtrack, and changes to client side structure blocks\n</details>\n\n\nI’ve spent over 1000 hours on my mods.

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name.

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:45:34.688950Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":10162233,"followers":6059,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv","7slRrLO6","BkJB5PPB","wmIZ4wP4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":854377,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba","sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1.jar":{"sha512":"a3bb0272c0a1a3be9250dfee030bb8f86217fa6a32bd534be8c940fdd8c466c800c2df85874877983ced36ecfc28c8ced6c0d42107c1ab621385b4be9a7c65eb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"aC3cM3Vq","slug":"mouse-tweaks","project_type":"mod","team":"Gn6mAc1d","title":"Mouse Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-08-17T15:54:24.539799Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3088908,"followers":2311,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K","GUHZDxpy","9IcJV4UJ","dUVBjrNs","ylmBQ38A","9I21YYxf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"7JVXOe3K","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.1

Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-06-13T17:19:35.226992Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":7574022,"followers":3147,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT","elFOHmh9","R7WWpY0Z","G8Aq3OEv","WTCAdLsq","MJUxq3kq","LXUa8bFw","h61Z2iVZ","dLAG06tP","CL7AHQsm","HHrwznjQ","XNQUud9H","rsM9VY0D","bovSU7Mt","EkAJiIZH","lALu7fvN","TD5Fv92S","ePcFYsKB","hf7D9v77","8DXWiiaq","mkXoQQMn","ZHFdxhFP","hCwZI62j","sDwfolBP","G2PcCpZl","3jH5u49m","RXrT2ogA","gQuF6HNa","C0nuSdTs","Jl7pSXPu","Ha6NtXW8","xiSmTJ03","zoyKoGDQ","Y8Wa10Re","DRI8KjDu","sjARwr7i"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"C0nuSdTs","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"YetAnotherConfigLib 3.5.0 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"3.5.0+1.20.1-forge","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.5.0\n\nThis build supports the following versions:\n- Fabric 1.20.1\n- Fabric 1.20.4\n- Fabric 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)\n- Fabric 1.21\n- NeoForge 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)\n- NeoForge 1.20.4\n- MinecraftForge 1.20.1\n\n## *Experimental* Codec Config\n\nThis update brings a new experimental config API that utilises Mojang's Codec for (de)serialization.\n\n```java\npublic class CodecConfig extends JsonFileCodecConfig/*or*/CodecConfig {\n    public static final CodecConfig INSTANCE = new CodecConfig();\n\n    public final ConfigEntry<Integer> myInt =\n            register(\"my_int\", 0, Codec.INT);\n\n    public final ReadonlyConfigEntry<InnerCodecConfig> myInnerConfig =\n            register(\"my_inner_config\", InnerCodecConfig.INSTANCE);\n\n    public CodecConfig() {\n        super(path);\n    }\n    \n    void test() {\n        loadFromFile();

Vanilla Minecraft is quite inefficient with particles in a variety of ways. Particle Core aims to improve this.**\n\n[![Join the Discord](https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png)](https://discord.gg/zDbaYmUba2)\n[![Ronald McDonald House Donation Link](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5f2635e02e8561eb3ae165bda17a9579841d3882.png)](https://tiltify.com/+team-timefall/team-timefall-annual-charity-2024)\n\n# What Does It Do?\n### Culling\nThe biggest performance improvement overall, Particle Core doesn't render particles you can't see. Makes sense! Only about a 12th of the lightbox is visible at standard FOVs, why render the 11/12 of particles you can't even see?\n\n### Rendering Optimizations\nParticles that are rendered are optimized. Vertex transformations and lightmap polling are optimized. Vertex optimizations defer to Sodium.\n\n### By-Type Reduction or Disabling\nThree methods are provided to either completely disable or reduce spawning of specific particle types. Any particle you can add via the /particle command is eligible.\n1) A particle_type tag. Add particle types to `particle_core:excluded_particles` to completely disable those particle types. **Server Owners: this will disable those particles for every client that joins the server, use with caution!**\n2) Config-based by-type reduction map. In the particle core config (see below), a user can add mappings of `particle type identifier` to `chance double`.\n3) Turn of Potion Particles entirely. If you find potion particles on your screen annoying, head over to the config and turn them off!\n\nUnlike invis-particle resource packs, this actually prevents the particles from spawning at all, improving performance.\n\n### Tweaking Vanilla settings\nTwo config options are provided that can fine-tune the standard vanilla options of `ALL`, `DECREASED`, and `MINIMAL`. One is effectively a dial between ALL and DECREASED, the second a dial between DECREASED and MINIMAL. If you simply want to tweak particle spawning a bit, for example if your computer runs fine with DECREASED but you personally don't like how many particles are still on screen, you can dial DECREASED back without going all the way to MINIMAL.\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Banner](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/85a7141b-76c9-4f0c-bd04-21f4b0d56c4a.webp \"Bisect Hosting Banner\")](https://bisecthosting.com/fzzyhmstrs)\n\n# Config\nParticle Core provides a config covering every feature added. locate the config in the standard .mincraft `config` folder. Config name is `particle_core_config_v[x].json`, where [x] is the current version number.\n\nThe config has a comprehensive \"comment\" section at the top of the file. Please read it for guidance on config usage.\n\n### turnOffPotionParticles\nTo some, potion particles are extremely annoying. Use this setting to turn them off.\n\n### reduceParticlesAllChance\nA dial to tweak particle spawning between the `ALL` and `DECREASED` Minecraft setting.\n\n### reduceParticlesDecreasedChance\nA dial to tweak particle spawning between the `DECREASED` and `MINIMAL` Minecraft setting.\n\n### disableParticles\nCompletely disable all client-side particle spawning.\n\n### reduceParticlesByType\nMap to reduce specific particle spawning.\n* key: identifier of the particle type, ex. `minecraft:smoke`.\n* value: double between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 will completely disable the particle, 1.0 is normal spawning. Anything in between will be that fractional chance a particle succeeds at spawning.\n\n### disableOptimizations\nIf any feature in Particle Core is causing a conflict or it is simply undesired, every feature can be individually disabled by adding it's string key to this list. See comment for instructions.\n\n# Before\nWithout Particle Core, world rendering is at 41% of CPU time, with renderParticles the lions share of that at 25% of CPU time.\n\n![Screenshot of a Spark Profile showing world rendering at 41% CPU time](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1147906974000889988/1215787139527082034/image.png?ex=65fe0502&is=65eb9002&hm=d8af4e1b31cbe3e7e986cdd7810c8c8a3266cff5dbe6c23996b0fb75f868f96f&)\n\n# After\nWith Particle Core, rendering is now at only 16% of CPU time, particle rendering basically a non-item.\n\n![Screenshot of a second Spark Profile showing world rendering at 16% CPU time](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1147906974000889988/1215790887800537088/image.png?ex=65fe087f&is=65eb937f&hm=dee67259c8a5648399e1b1caf7e08f83041d503b172d1c24054dd8a57ba075c7&=&format=webp&quality=lossless)\n\n# With Sodium\nImproves performance over Sodium by itself.

customizable food group-based nutrition and diet system.","body":"Diet is a mod that facilitates the creation and management of dietary food groups in Minecraft. Diet comes with a default configuration that creates five classical food groups (fruits, grains, vegetables, proteins, and sugars). The mod is highly configurable; users and modpack developers can define their own food groups, classifications, and diet effects.\n\n## Features\n\n### Food Groups\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/BLYDcbT/diet-screen.png)\n\nFood groups are custom dietary groups that represent the types of food that you have eaten. Each group has a value ranging between 0% and 100% depending on how much of that particular category that\na player has eaten. These values increase depending on what types of food a player eats and every group gradually decays when the player uses up their hunger bar.\n\nBy default, Diet comes with five classical food groups: Fruits, Grains, Proteins, Vegetables, and Sugars.\n\nBy editing the `diet-groups.toml` configuration file in the world save's `serverconfig` folder, users and modpack developers can create their own custom food groups. Configurable options include:\n\n- Name\n- Item Icon\n- Hexcode Color\n- Ordering\n- Default Value\n- Gain Multiplier\n- Decay Multiplier\n\nPlease refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Diet/wiki) for more detailed information.\n\n### Dietary Effects\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7vmZfpD/diet-effects.png)\n\nDietary effects are custom rewards or penalties applied to players based on certain, configurable food group values. These effects can be configured through the `diet-effects.toml` file in the world save's `serverconfig` folder.\n\nPossible effects can include any registered potion effect, vanilla and modded, as well as modifying attributes directly (i.e. increasing maximum health by an arbitrary value). The conditions for these effects are highly configurable, including checking specific values, checking only subsets of groups, applying effects cumulatively for each matching test, and much more.\n\nPlease refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Diet/wiki) for more detailed information.\n\n##

style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Neapolitan is&nbsp;a food mod with&nbsp;a different&nbsp;approach. Rather than raw stats, Neapolitan's foods do things to give them each&nbsp;a niche. Neapolitan food is sort of divided by flavors, which all involve exploring the&nbsp;world, rather than purely consisting of crafting recipes.

src=\"https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/banner.png\">\n\n[<img alt=\"discord-plural\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/social/discord-plural_vector.svg\">](https://discord.gg/WcYsDDQtyR)\n[<img alt=\"kofi-singular\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/donate/kofi-singular_vector.svg\">](https://ko-fi.com/enjarai)\n## Overview\n\nDo a Barrel Roll is a lightweight, fully clientside mod that changes \nelytra flight to be more fun and semi-realistic.\nIt achieves this by redesigning movement with a \ncompletely unlocked camera orientation in mind, \nallowing for full pitch, yaw and roll control in flight.\n\nSome subtle and less subtle modifiers are also applied to the camera,\nincluding but not limited to smoothing and banking.\n\n**On Fabric:**\n\n[<img alt=\"fabric-api\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/requires/fabric-api_vector.svg\">](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n[<img alt=\"fabric-api\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://enjarai.dev/static/requires_cicada_cozy.svg\">](https://modrinth.com/mod/cicada)\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/ravine.gif)\n\n## Controls\n\nThe default controls are as follows, but can be modified:\n\n- Mouse x axis to roll\n- Mouse y axis to pitch\n- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe mod can be configured in-game using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).\nOnce you install both of these,\nyou can access the config screen by finding the mod in the mods list and pressing the config button.\n\nA wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and\nchanging values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.\n\n## Server-side features\n\nVisual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between \nclients by installing it on the server-side as well. \nEverything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. \nAll the following configurations are valid:\n\n- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced\n- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals\n- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals\n- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot\n- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nThis mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, \nso in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. \nHowever, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement\nand may get you flagged.\n**Use at your own risk.**\n\n**Versions prior to 2.8.3 may not be suitable for use on multiplayer servers due to lax server-side restrictions**\n\n## Credits\n\nBased on the [Cool Elytra Roll](https://github.com/Jorbon/cool_elytra) mod by [Jorbon](https://github.com/Jorbon),\nspecifically it's \"realistic mode\".\n\nOriginally ported to Forge by [MehVahdJukaar](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar).\nModern Forge port based on [Sinytra's multiloader template](https://github.com/Sinytra/MultiLoader-Template).\n\nMod icon by Mizeno.\n","published":"2022-08-22T16:00:39.121484Z","updated":"2024-08-12T08:23:38.258941Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1148308,"followers":1510,"categories":["equipment","transportation"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["FBF1osil","NlqhjyCI","Tne4pAY5","RdGeOLDB","XcYpP7ig","LactAtLB","afCcLQ1c","DtlcR4vt","5O3dPR9X","KzcdQ9FU","oIbVdzDn","q0stzwqc","htOChW49","sRNui8uR","65fVXLz3","5te3CHsv","2NVQ8FN1","O7xueryC","wK9XqoTM","5GlNCgf2","KigHzrzN","1sryaevE","sx58gc3e","By23e8Rx","efjOZLaq","ydgYYE9t","2LAYV4Yy","l1OtiztH","pSUyYuUs","yEP0r6Ew","A6VLpD97","D1sCy5H6","bR8uktFD","veIjf9eb","vzw5YS5Z","DwcmCwIe","nrEBLBMS","AWbu44WI","ltHynVRp","2bKiSrV1","qziJgmV7","Ws8I3F28","NrmDUOJh","u01IgEvL","KnimXV6c","Hfw3cWFy","2nnTjpM4","vLiy6emu","SMTZR2CA","m0uwZ4Md","udQpOG4e","psj0IIJ5","8jV0jGc4","15oiPLsb","UyB2v0D5","xhkQ6rwl","Va6KeLzG","sGSmyzfS","Eunepnp9","ehY7RHs7","rNLVNbXo","v0Hg3qaE","kLZwBJcX","cQpF8MVo","XqkJ2I6G","Pbsj8g4U","WJIph4ys","jS3Nv7i1","wTBxfiYI","9mMDXR35","sOAes0g5","ZIVSKDMl","pPjoi45i","UA9IRVr3","XjYxU38d","pcOcGh6r","au3ce2ic","i3cCcNIa","jhwKfxBc","thu8z32t","oPsCVHAx","oszZ7uZz","6N2mSGPm","EWRGHy3g","QKDc4J7Z","XjHa44dr","piNWn5F8","9nFs4ToQ","nw0hSXru","a2ikZBtM","D6DdoR3w","DNIT5vUX","E6Rqbi6I","lmCjE3pH","HzO2s9YI","JdhmWEXC","8Z6qjSak","9mAq86OS","QXFEoWz0","B7cLLqEG","p2kiit3r","Tw7IzpBC","49BAMaJx","qYn0YE9S","FGguxlbf","hxUi39OJ","9oeV1gFl","e1JDHe9b","50i0VClG","Vm945UCb","eE2kjsho","nybnGUJv","2GZpcF7N","BbZhZNIX","NeQj3Fz9","gtLI94FF","fkl7bxl7","jD6tD3Ck","HsKAadOS","jveY9zir","CNM3smnf","7a5Vl6bt","rIfOMh9m","c8TlDgSJ","uNVp4YAh","2f37LU7J","1CTfnpHI","lPiCk49y","QcCmwDIK","IfRYowB0","cXepeLYw","iclteRK7","AK6qVse9","ln8C5QJj","Ws6fWaHi","B47f6kqW","gbxieggJ","5wwdjkF4","6sLkwKoK","BdBAMCep","3trypJmH","zFfB9gke","xXQOdU31","YcHNDCOO","hZ2m2dCd","aMOITkqD","TN8tlPYz","JCUASO47","BEgYscT7","IQXyiTai","xrNZLxUL","uzOm8tez","kRrQPKRd","PJCutXpv","cjOnrxD6","o2ffIR7z","vLGZctV5","UI3NfPIy","orKHsnsv","hsg4BN2T","S0QngIQM","Tc6hshn5","s4zNwCf2","34jQR2SU","Rboy7btV","jB6dU7ir","zzTTYEGP","yqGJz0MG","oExHpF2v","5mn6dm6c","VFrYSyNB","GSWLE8Yp","jxec8n0p","rzK5er8a","QTZWPLMO","eyGO4rWH","oLVOsTht","RlVXmJeD","9xcYWEMM","5OZhAiaw","pJSq0gmP","VH8QpKA5","swE82BGE","vhbUNxBk","1alzQQhn","l4f77JZk","RkvZ8dFD","VhftET6c","iKLtnuLB","vnywyrWt","eVfj9RoR","CJFnOoi0","CuLlUIYD","OjBr3egj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6FtRfnLg/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"VH8QpKA5","project_id":"6FtRfnLg","author_id":"TCTaOCuS","featured":false,"name":"3.5.6

This means that its features can range from blocks, to items, blocks, storage... et cetera.

No backports are planned.\n\n# Content\n\n![tab](https://i.imgur.com/b2R2Ddr.png)\n\n### To take a closer look at the features, go to the images section or even look at the wiki!\n**Currently both the image section and the wiki is wip, but will be updated soon**\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n- **Bismuth** : \nBismuth is a new ore found in the nether, when mined it gives experience like quartz, but its main focus is decoration and utilities. Bismuth blocks change color slowly over time and Bismuth Ingots can apply this kind of iridescence onto other vanilla blocks. Bismuth is also used to craft a **Chisel**, that can turn blocks into their chiseled form or remove iridescence, a  **Hammer** that can either be used for combat or to crack blocks (both the se items use a .json file format for their \"recipes\" for mod compat) and a  **Wrench**, a survival friendly debug stick that can modify blockstates in a limited fashion\n\n- **Handbell** : The Handbell is new item that is obtained from villagers and can call your pets or following allays to you when ringed if they are not sitting, and give them the glowing effect\n\n- **Drum** : A new noteblock like block that changes sound based on the block below and where the player hits the its top\n\n- **Dice** : A simple and compact redstone randomizer\n\n- **Frame** : A new block that assists builders into making, well, frameworks. It can be placed and replaced later without needing to be broken\n\n- **Prickly Can** : A storage block made with cactus that can delete all the items inside with a click\n\n- **Bouquet** : New items crafted with small flowers, it can only be placed in pots and on vases\n\n- **Vase** : A new block made with rooted dirt, it removes the offset of every block placed on top of it to make for great decoration\n\n- **Item Stand & Glowing Item Stand** :  Like an Item Frame, but in the middle of a block. You can click it with Glass to cover the item for bonus aesthetic points\n\n- **Squid Lamp** : A lamp made with Glow Ink Sacks, can be placed like a torch, glows much brighter underwater\n\n- **Tidal Helmet** :  New armor piece crafted with a Turtle Helmet and a Heart Of the Sea, its a much stronger version of the Turtle Helmet that gives Conduit Power, but also grants more Durability and Strength. This also comes with a new ui element that indicates how much conduit power you have left\n\n- **Turtle Raft** : New boat type entity, it can only old one passenger, but can be dyed like leather armor and can be adorned with banners. Its resistant to water bubble columns and can also fit through one block gaps\n\n- **Crumbling Stone** : A new type of stone that crumbles. When standing, jumping or hitting it with a projectile it starts breaking until you're left with no stone... It can be waxed to use as a decoration though!\n\n- **Leveled Stone** : Used to make Crumbling Stone, mainly used for decoration with it\n\n- **Light Bulb & Tinted Light Bulb** : A new light source that can be right-clicked to change the light value. Tinted Light Bulbs randomly flicker \n\n- **Chapples & Golden Chapples** : Chapples are a new Mooshroom-like Chicken mob, they can be spawned from a Eggple (found in Plains Villages and Pillager Outposts) and they lay Apples instead of Eggs. When a Chapple is struck by lightning or when it's spawned from a Golden Eggple (found in Bastions) it becomes a Golden Chapple, which has only a chance to lay Golden Apples instead of regular Apples\n\n- **Cotton** : Cotton is a new Crop, its seeds are traded by Villagers and found in Plains Villages, it gives Cotton when fully grown, which can be turned into Cotton Clothes, String or Wool\n\n- **Cotton Clothes** : New armor like items that come in 16 colors + Wandering Trader exclusive variant, sometimes have custom models and are slimmer than armor to fit your skin better.

It allows you to\n\tcustomize the length of the day-night cycle and alters the Minecraft sleep mechanic by accelerating\n\tthe speed of time.\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\nThis mod (optionally) **replaces the vanilla sleep functionality with a smooth and natural transition\nto morning** by accelerating the passage of time while you're in bed. In multiplayer, time will pass\nfaster depending on the percentage of players who are currently sleeping. This removes the need for\nany sleep voting system or player threshold, as any number of players can have an impact on the\nduration of the night.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nHourglass allows for **customization of the day-night cycle duration**, and can control day and night\nspeed independently. Rather than the vanilla duration of 20 minutes, you can slow down time to make\na day in Minecraft last as long as a day in real life, or speed up the passage of nights for a more\nforgiving experience.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nHourglass also provides a number of **time effects** that may speed up the progression of various\nelements in Minecraft to match the current speed of time. Some examples include crop growth, grass\ngrowth, weather, potion effects, furnaces, hoppers, etc. Most of these time effects are disabled by\ndefault but can be enabled by setting their associated [config options](#configuration).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nHourglass is compatible with the following mods:\n\n* [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts)\n* [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons)\n* [Enhanced Celestials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-celestials)\n* [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark)  \n  * The Improved Sleeping module of Quark interferes with the sleep feature of Hourglass.\n    [See note below.](#sleep-vote-mods)  \n  * The \"Nerf Clock\" Quark option breaks the bed clock in Hourglass. Either the Quark tweak should\n    be disabled or the Hourglass Bed Clock should be disabled via the `displayBedClock` config.\n* [Morpheus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/morpheus)  \n  * The sleep feature of Hourglass will need to be disabled to use it alongside Morpheus.\n    [See note below.](#sleep-vote-mods)\n* [Good Night's Sleep](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/good-nights-sleep)\n\n#### Sleep Vote Mods\n\nHourglass is compatible with mods that enable sleep voting or have sleep percentage systems like\nQuark and Morpheus, but they conflict with the sleep feature of this mod. These features should\neither be disabled in their corresponding mods, or the sleep feature in Hourglass should be disabled.\nThe sleep feature can be disabled via command or file by modifying the `enableSleepFeature` option.\n\n#### Other Compatibility Notes\n\nThe Overworld is currently the only dimension supported. However, most dimensions in Minecraft\n(including custom dimensions) derive their time information from the Overworld and will therefore\nelapse time at the same rate.\n\n## Commands\n\n#### `/hourglass config <config-key> [<value>]`\n\nModifies or displays the current value of the specified config option.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nIf the `<value>` argument is omitted, this command will display the config option's current value.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nSome configurations are not available through this command and need to be accessed via the config files.\n\n#### `/hourglass query timeSpeed`\n\nDisplays the current speed at which time is elapsing.\n\n#### `/hourglass query sleeperCount`\n\nDisplays the ratio of players sleeping in the current dimension.\n\n## Configuration\n\nAll configuration values can be changed at runtime without reloading the game.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWhile many of the configuration options are accessible through via the\n[config command](#hourglass-config-config-key-value), some can only be accessed by visiting the\nmod's config files. Most of the options are located in the mod's\n[server config file](#default-server-config) in both single-player worlds and multiplayer servers.\nA few client-specific options also exist in the [client config file](#default-client-config).\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nModpack developers may customize the Hourglass server settings in their modpack by first tweaking\nthe server settings in a test world and then moving the file to the `./defaultconfigs` folder of\ntheir modpack. Forge will move all files in the `defaultconfigs` folder into the `serverconfig`\nfolder of all newly created worlds.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWhen customizing Hourglass, the **speed of time** is controlled using a multiplier. A value of 1 is equivalent\nto vanilla speed (20 minutes for a full day-night cycle). Setting daySpeed and nightSpeed to 0.5\nwill cut the speed of time in half, doubling the duration of a full day to 40 minutes. Likewise,\ndoubling the configured speed to 2.0 will result in a shortened day lasting only 10 minutes from\none morning to the next.\n\n> _**Warning:** Setting daySpeed and nightSpeed to values higher than 3600 may be unsafe for people with photosensitive epilepsy._\n\n### Default Server Config\n\nLocation relative to Minecraft folder:\n* Single-player worlds: `./saves/<save>/serverconfig/hourglass-server.toml`\n* Multiplayer servers: `./world/serverconfig/hourglass-server.toml`\n\n```toml\n[time]\n\t#The speed at which time passes during the day.\n\t#Day is defined as any time between 23500 (middle of dawn) and 12500 (middle of dusk) the next day.\n\t#Vanilla speed: 1.0\n\t#Range: 0.0 ~ 24000.0\n\tdaySpeed = 1.0\n\n\t#The speed at which time passes during the night.\n\t#Night is defined as any time between 12500 (middle of dusk) and 23500 (middle of dawn).\n\t#Vanilla speed: 1.0\n\t#Range: 0.0 ~ 24000.0\n\tnightSpeed = 1.0\n\n\t[time.effects]\n\t\t#When applied, this effect syncs the passage of weather with the current speed of time.\n\t\t#I.e., as time moves faster, rain stops faster.

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2024-08-18T10:48:00.579676Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":2731296,"followers":545,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku","8UWgitat","AgF88xAa","LAcFOrdR","3sq8rKNi","WXnNfkOQ","bRdRjsBw","2RKyBUJh","8BAEKNuN","cEVwMp3J","5NKdFoez","StBAz5jK","dRWTiq1o","dLc984Lh","OWzOhWa1","IVjsKfDz","cFgWr0uf","wnLFf0Nc","rCLaOh9e","zxsIL6hW","DKi9sJC8","7wOWxvtd","BMFYaPZ4","pg9Xxrcb","t5FnO6dP","zQA9lTQr","cv8vKRPe","TDf2CeG9","FubHdmUL","7NLlFrFF","8og81efu","NBLqXmpa","IZUE22nG","JQtrjbXM","Ss8gDP6F","Jv6lR8aV","Fi0TCD7O","6AG0cMX6","uMZCwusw","oi8DYts3","5QbwmlBE","n3GjNlx6","ycRzQlXJ","oTRatPAP","yquNskKL","CbCy1LiO","M8sd9nyu","e93w6V0s","hCmcGN2x","WtQPtpOg","OkmMqBP5","ypbJKwW0","wwZF0CTX","fNxFC0pt","PXdkmy2e","favv6G7H","jOzdT1LR","gnSKWxm4","ZgfYQJJR","7PV35Cya","s2SeQuIY","JDl2M220","LdkViV3L","kxERHwYJ","njpFMA6B","pk2qJx6m","UnP0v4AC","aeiy0BML","Go1eYHmQ","Cuzt6kYP","js8YrtNd","Asee8uGo","UYBCMpsC","iAUu6joU","xGNGCHkB","7r8TleZN","GaHAWKFN","aoXpagIV","5Ic61SOJ","Y2coeQBy","wldQnfTY","WRTGYYwK","rL76IQAG","kWp5Y5C9","FSr3bS7l","g1NYtQkD","sBdauEYc","jwHI7W1V","Hrg4AXGA","cP4hkgv1","CUoXbepB","zRXo9SbS","zYK4kSID","7X9Ap8XG","OS1Spie4","nOP9IgtT","qZEcqr3j","H78hNSMP","u5W05Nll","uKalHaQF","DCYqLiyn","yui9wjUi","vivHKObd","2RDhJhN7","unsnRxp1","elfXvPlb","QplPUcMZ","o50IGtrs","SBI44BXf","CV8lDNyD","2O5fg0oB","JEGquuvM","kxiwYQnp","tAnlg8ff","tNmV8F3e","bIIUFcYw","WOsQY4RE","qDW4WXAw","p6nioh9J","XdWNv88P","DoxaOeBf","fLxJRzSX","cdNu7PK8","l53OchaO","ZloMzYX2","luqVInL6","c1lxzTbA","ZOqeyUiV","ej91c9V8","93Yehddj","7saLSGbf","OOWX2Oij","Funmd64I","LazriRXO","oM4tZMNR","mrMZDCEp","dYm8xmxC","qaPBcEwV","W3TFpB71","xAoofRnn","uv4zha4H","erMSGCtZ","TrNPp0VJ","syE4OiG7","3WzCZus7","P1OnKMWx","z5otFTC5","EghVG3Df","4aP9Rkxt","X5QZyeHj","N9LlGRuD","yqHXozvj","rPFKzJR5

The book is still WIP and has no recipe, but you can get and read it in creative mode  \n- [NoMoreGlowingPotions](https://modrinth.com/mod/nomoreglowingpots) is highly suggested to appreciate the actual potion colors, instead of the weird glowing effect that makes them all look the same.  \n\n## Potions and Recipes\n  \n  \nEvery single potion recipe can be individually disabled in the config file.  \nAll potions in this mod are brewed in the vanilla Brewing Stand with vanilla items and have the standard splash, lingering and arrow variants; some of them may also have redstone and glowstone enhancements.  \nNot all potions are available in fabric yet. I'm slowly working on it, don't worry!  \n \n## Brewing Stand Tweak\n  \n  \nThere are two kind of people in this world, those who like the blaze powder requirement for brewing stands, and those who don't. I belong to the latter. A config now allows brewing stands to be powered by a fire underneath, or really anything made of fire/lava material. It is kinda slow, but I feel like it is a good compromise for fuel, it makes so much more sense to me. Note that blaze powder will still work, this is just an alternative. The option can be turned off in the config.  \nHeat sources and conductive materials can be specified through the tags `extraalchemy:heat_source` and `extraalchemy:heat_conductor`.\n \n## Vials\n  \n  \nVials are my version of a stackable potion system. Craft a splash potion with an empty vial to get a vial of the potion, or right click an empty vial to fill with the first potion found in your inventory. Vials apply the effect on the player immediately and can be stacked up to 16. To craft an empty vial make the same recipe of a glass bottle in the bottom rows and put a flint in the top-center slot.\n\n## Potion Bag\n\n\nThe potion bag is a handy way to carry around your potions. You can store any drinkable brew inside, and select one type to have quick access to. To access the bag interface shift-right click the bag. Using a simple right click will administer the potion, or it will select the next available type when you run out of the selected one.  \nA keybind can be used while holding a bag to decide what happens when a potion runs out: deselect everything, select next potion, or keep unavailable potion selected.  \nYou can also dye them like leather armor! (They should retain their settings and inventory in doing so, too)\n\n## Potion Rings\n\n\nThe potion rings are a way to have a semi-persistent potion effect. Combine an empty ring with any valid vanilla potion to get the corresponding ring.   \nThis feature can be disabled or configured through the config file.  \nThe ring will apply the potion over time to the wearer, and every available potion is customized to allow different xp costs for more powerful potions.  \nEvery potion also has a customized duration when applied, and XP cost and renewal time can be defined separatedly (aka: no more flashing night vision potion, as the renewal time is at 18s, making the potion go from 36s to 18s, instead of waiting for it to go all the way to 0).  \nNew potions with custom XP cost, level, duration and renewal time can be defined through the vanilla recipe system which is automatically fetched from the server on connection. [Example](https://github.com/zabi94/ExtraAlchemy/tree/1.16-fabric/src/main/resources/data/extraalchemy/recipes/ring_recipes).  \nUsing the same name of a mod-defined json, and setting the output to be a \"useless potion\" (water/awkward/mundane/thick...) will disable that ring.  \nWhen Trinkets is installed, rings will work in the ring slot!\n\n\n## Potion Tooltip Icons\n\nSince 1.18.2 there's the option to see the potion icons on the tooltips of potion-bearing items, like drinking/splash/lingering potions, tipped arrows, vials, potion rings and loaded potion bags:\n\n![potion icon image](https://zabi94.dev/mc_screenshots/tooltip_icons.png)\n\n\n## Bug Support\n  \n1) Install the latest available version for your minecraft version and try again   \n2) If the bug still persist, open a new issue **on Github**  \n\n\n \n## Will you port to...?\n  \n- Past versions: No. Stop asking.\n- Future versions: Sure, on fabric, when I have time. Keep in mind I have a life and a full time job.\n- Forge: No. [Gretchen, stop trying to make Forge happen, it's not going to happen](https://youtu.be/Pubd-spHN-0?t=2). Not even if someone else offers. _I don't want to_ have a forge version.\n\n\n## Currently supported versions:  \n- 1.19.2 and before: No  \n- **1.19.3**: Supported  \n- **1.20 snapshots**: development will begin shortly\n\n\n## Modpack policy\n  \n  \nYou can redistribute the jar **as part of modpacks** if you include a link redirecting to either this page or Curseforge's page.   \n\nDo not redistribute the mod as a single jar, please.\n\nAt the current time, multiple websites are violating this policy, so if you downloaded the mod from them or you visualized their ad-gates, you are actively supporting this practice; please, try to access the files from the original source.  \nJust to mention a few that you should avoid:  \n\n- minecraft-forum .net\n- 9minecraft .net\n- ign .com\n- 8minecraft .com\n- 9minecraft-mods.blogspot .it\n- minecraft-inside .ru\n\n[Read more here!](http://stopmodreposts.org) (You can also download and install a browser plugin from this link, it will help you block malicious sites)\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Vazkii and wiiv for kindly providing the original textures for the potion effects, and to she_is_long for reworking all of them (+item textures) to the new Minecraft art style! &lt;3*\n\n ","published":"2021-03-03T07:54:19.305062Z","updated":"2024-03-09T10:58:43.777543Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":149106,"followers":215,"categories":["equipment","magic","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-rc1","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["W2XUMxdH","PNmr2iGU","QyXldeI1","CujvY5kV","jDkpjBJZ","k1biqr1E","YkqwMXcq","114GATGr","enpp5Ldu","Z3fyvKQ5","tAu1NVUt","b9ArwEwV","TpwPJBqV","p6wL4IL7","Xc7L1V6F","on6IEEcc","pzSRx3lI","Hp9hpnqj","IHospzO1","VEkp93me"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n0S5OkPo/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"on6IEEcc","project_id":"n0S5OkPo","author_id":"EJcF9xaL","featured":false,"name":"Extra Alchemy 1.10.0","version_number":"1.10.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-30T19:01:40.554311Z","downloads":76263,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d1175cf372fd9d6f5cf063a67511e62fbe83feae","sha512":"2206cd9274f0e6a698adcdc22e1748b1a9240294e9ebe09d15a33ea9eb7fce3ebd96da9428fbe68fad70226835a3a2528f83e08af4d579b9975ad2755a3cdae9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n0S5OkPo/versions/on6IEEcc/extraalchemy-fabric-1.20.1-1.10.0.jar","filename":"extraalchemy-fabric-1.20.1-1.10.0.jar","primary":true,"size":1234909,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"t5W7Jfwy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"bGfsSwPy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"5aaWibi9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8spxJ5qd","user":{"id":"EJcF9xaL","username":"zabi94","name":"ZaBi94","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11521878?v=4","bio":"Just a guy having fun coding, to hopefully make a job out of this.","created":"2020-10-19T16:32:22.581413Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"extraalchemy-fabric-1.20.1-1.10.0.jar"},"mods\\breezy-1.20.1-1.2.1.jar":{"sha512":"33b11708843535c129fcfcf5697a54d96c779a257229d4e796a55aa9285aff45a06d00b3edc679cd92062c957eef4b790e226bbb1facd644e57a23eae93a9fd4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AiTMEFuN","slug":"breezy","project_type":"mod","team":"EXzsEeA5","title":"Breezy","description":"A unique approach to hot air balloons!","body":"![Breezy image description](https://imgur.com/UDZLMEm.png)\n\n\n![BisectHosting affiliate code (codyhuh)](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/549ed6c6-79e9-4524-b62d-aaff4e724aa9.webp)\n\n<details>\n<summary>Text Description</summary>\n\n # Breezy\n\nBreezy adds a few new wind related features such as wind particles and hot air balloons!\n\nWind particles display above ground in various Overworld biomes.

unofficial architectury port.\nA dynamic lights mod for Minecraft.","body":"# RyoamicLights\n\n<img alt=\"forge\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/supported/forge_vector.svg\">\n<img alt=\"fabric\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/supported/fabric_vector.svg\">\n\n[LambDynamicLights](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) **unofficial architectury port**.\n\nA dynamic lights mod for Minecraft.\n\n## 📖 What's this mod?\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? \n[Check out this list!](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives)\n\n### What's this name?\n\nNow the name wasn't even born in the beginning, it was going to be called TexTrue's Dynamic Lights, but I don't really like having anything named after me, and then I started to think about combining Dynamic Lights with other Japanese anime character names, and realized that Ryo Yamada (\"Bocchi The Rock!\" Kessoku Band's bassist) was the best choice (maybe?).\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with  [ObsidianUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/obsidianui)\n, (and [Sodium (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Embeddium (Fabric/Forge/NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via Mod List, you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/ryoamiclights.toml`.\n\n## 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)/[Embeddium (Forge/NeoForge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) is recommended for better performances.\n- **OptiFine/OptiForge/OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n- [Incompatible list](https://github.com/ThinkingStudios/RyoamicLights/issues/6)\n\n## 📖 License\nThis mod is under MIT license.","published":"2023-09-16T08:14:10.650962Z","updated":"2024-08-18T12:02:36.945613Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":305500,"followers":275,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["m7Lgm8hK","LZLtVgqa","nIO7QC7M","igllhLFS","1erCetvG","zWFbKQhD","RhNYCcIM","7dqU8eac","BgMtpRGo","DdwTwijv","bwlFgqWO","L5KtvJvn","IZqfjY96","jsZuXFzy","uzzXZrCs","RrIca7qx","cYFh4a2b","YgHO99D8","kgF8B46D","T4KlCMzj","18FTecpJ","xoCdiQHY","bhpUY0SA","d4rDqsnh","1HYIaLuU","BzdfpZfe","BAVFDr9B","8xdhlPCJ","iN95aGh4","Q5QeW2N7","urYBzvtU","moeCujqS","Q3dbVMx1","gL4xb5aw","29VEzD1q","sS8xNLfi","oN4QkegK","IQ1uiXHc","3nMO9jfc","AMvRSg7p","doJw68CH","YyRYjgpq","X857RLfZ","qO6GwRlw","wGVPnuOQ","HOHsa6Ij","CbDFbHrH","GXdBQIBF","Uz6TYn6f","UGTsNdUR","euzZ7R0y","aMDVprYS","WRwefikH","8UDusBKo","2q05WlUa","LghoZVDG","d9jnqqBp","uWZt54MJ","Ibl9WDtW","KMEZDiuh","zfxPcTIH","1GpjHSCQ","rg95B4dn","6ke1hVvZ","cMsJhzz1","pg7wiFsB","tO1MiEO4","EdjwaXwJ","KIUKMIXH","pu9jKeK9","ux5bh0h1","VTzHz71U","c2Th4NIB","qGKe5QHU","PJHSvVOR","fIzuAgUh","57hUqHDh","7lXeYdGV","A1Z7TP49","7Np8Rk9W","zYTGJ1uH","cWVKZOIE","SZrWYqw9","lSVpt79H","lvpfsK5V","ojqaR5dJ","TEiHtdfP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/reCfnRvJ/64f306245c75a736036263299e6312318a3a05c5.png"},"version":{"id":"c2Th4NIB","project_id":"reCfnRvJ","author_id":"oOhH1tPz","featured":false,"name":"[Forge]

Free Levels","description":"Flattens the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs and makes renaming items always cost 1 level","body":"Reaching high levels in Minecraft is hard, because each level requires more XP than the last.  \n<br>\nSince Anvils and Enchantment Tables work off of levels, not off of collected XP, that means the higher your level, the higher the actual cost in terms of XP.  \n<br>\nTax Free Levels flattens the curve of the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs above level 30, meaning you'll always pay the same amount of XP, regardless of how high your level is.   \nIt also makes it so that renaming an item always only costs 1 level.  \n<br>\nMore precisely:  \nIf you are above level 30, instead of e.g. paying 3 levels, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from level 27 to 30.  \nIf the level cost is above 30, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from 0 to that level.\n\n* for Fabric Minecraft 1.16-1.20\n* required on the server and client\n* (it *does* work server-only, but the level cost won't show up correctly when renaming items)\n* compatible with Draylar1's [Reroll](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reroll)\n* compatible with

No code was taken, only the idea.","published":"2021-04-11T09:38:08.008060Z","updated":"2024-05-23T12:43:09.660636Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":218748,"followers":437,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["kyjJQ6is","NQmkmN36","2maMKx5T","6jbcl9c6","EGIMsnwc","fjgH8VUW","TuxALvSu","HnEdtPAA","OuxiHpnF","BPNCpouX","d4aBYiqJ","MZ3KFvJD","xRFlf1Co","Yzz234vY","KIjmjizn","LjDUjZCq","yEyvB3UM","6RvulguJ","wQCx7LxJ","bMwjs3jk","Snmnhtv7","O5rb19U4","HVJFHnm0","hTA88KZf","k7fgGv6V","UdBtR2xM","I0zqOeJG","gZ1xkqNs","AlYgBMY1","FIBdjomr","B0IoQ4DN","hpR2Y8l4","gaDYXPBy","tkf6AdLD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jCBrrLTs/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"hpR2Y8l4","project_id":"jCBrrLTs","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.3.13-forge","version_number":"1.3.13","changelog":"remove Waystones compatibility for newer Forge and NeoForge versions since it now uses an XP cost by default","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-23T12:42:18.799078Z","downloads":8694,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"bdbade96b8b8bdd5efeaffb92ca7346434edb146","sha512":"5444689fbc979071d125c1f6a42ecde5738a65b892c715430b5f6658864a86aa1ab57f44901497fdf3009c602fb7b57337d4eb4ea01c517d30a38b99c77b285a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jCBrrLTs/versions/hpR2Y8l4/TaxFreeLevels-1.3.13-forge-1.20.2.jar","filename":"TaxFreeLevels-1.3.13-forge-1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":19380,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"izaW93I5","user":{"id":"INxNlPeV","username":"Fourmisain","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8464472?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-24T22:05:23.378029Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TaxFreeLevels-1.3.13-forge-1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\mutil-1.20.1-6.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"736db7c6931244dbf67eb7116211149ff09b7cc368d7f49274152d8ea831b663ff50dc38789b667ef366777e3dacfe72d93b332f2d9e8a3eaef1827fdb6ce291","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"HWHl8Evb","slug":"mutil","project_type":"mod","team":"SXUbBN5B","title":"mutil","description":"Library of utilities used in all of my mods.","body":"Formerly mGui.\n\nContains:\n * Easy data management\n * Network utilities\n * Hierarchical UI rendering with animation support and an anchor based layout system\n * Perks queries\nPrimarily used in tetra.\n \n## Perks\nmutil hosts a perk system in versions for minecraft 1.19+,  which tetra (and likely other mods in the future) uses to provide contributors and supporters with cosmetics.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious.

Paxi adds the <b><em>paxi</em></b> folder in your Minecraft config folder, where you can place data and resource packs that will automatically be loaded for every world. The first time you run Paxi, the <b><em>paxi&nbsp;</em></b>folder will be created for you in your Minecraft config directory.</p>\n\n<p>Paxi is as simple as it gets when it comes to global data and resource packs, making it a great utility for modpack creators!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9VzCAAC.png\" alt=\"Data packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nWithin the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <b><em>datapacks</em></b> folder for data packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play - in other words, globally loaded data packs! When in game, use the command <code>/datapack list</code> to see all loaded data packs; packs loaded by Paxi are printed in pink text. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.</p>\n\n<p>\nData packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>datapack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of data pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your data packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any data packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal data packs). So if you only have a few data packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSWd9iG.png\" alt=\"Resource Packs\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAlso within the <em>paxi</em> folder is a <em><b>resourcepacks</b></em> folder for resource packs. This folder will be created for you the first time you run the game with Paxi installed. Any resource packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded when you start the game. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported. Resource packs are not supported on dedicated servers, since they only affect the game on the client-side (textures, sounds, and other assets).</p>\n\n<p>\nResource packs can also be loaded in a specific order! The first time you create or load a world with Paxi installed, the <em><b>resourcepack_load_order.json</b></em> file will be created for you in the <em>paxi</em> directory. You can fill this JSON file with a list of resource pack folder names (including the .zip for zip files) in the order you want your resource packs loaded in. Using this JSON file is entirely optional - any resource packs not listed in the file will be loaded normally (alphabetically by folder/zip file name, same as normal resource packs). So if you only have a few resource packs that require loading in a specific order, you only need to list them in the JSON!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:58:44.154428Z","updated":"2024-07-24T22:04:52.422825Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":702727,"followers":226,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["fZAUUop4","PGslvGfk","nAUDoZw6","guE4gNYH","QzQxGeh0","ncI5s51y","PndwEY0C","t0EvcKWk","C7buFh0l","UVPLKCqf","dfKKJWz8","kOPN246o","ocPyiL4C","DMlcRLLS","QGaIWzeS","uZ8fe7Rg","U1iCcvJ6","SELXigfX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CU0PAyzb/a44cd118cf27547d17dc13a008cdb4efe53aa6d1.png"},"version":{"id":"C7buFh0l","project_id":"CU0PAyzb","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0 (Forge)","version_number":"1.20-Forge-4.0","changelog":"1.20 and 1.20.1 release!  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-12T22:26:03.431847Z","downloads":155434,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"50ed8c99981b9860c846a18cda215d388b67019b76a172833fa4e4b52cbd122eb8e49e594e5789790f95af06e0a98dcf2433b001b1f559b3e7071d2e6b7c1dd7","sha1":"a3a7008e07a27b3c831af7e4c82fbbc10a4da328"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CU0PAyzb/versions/C7buFh0l/Paxi-1.20-Forge-4.0.jar","filename":"Paxi-1.20-Forge-4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":96892,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uDMN8ZzP","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"uDMN8ZzP","user":{"id":"f74fCorY","username":"Drullkus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5010174?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-12T01:48:09.113754Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Paxi-1.20-Forge-4.0.jar"},"mods\\farmersrespite-1.20.1-2.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"a6969c20c04fcbe378b5088b8f00f02e70d27747bcb2814f642d3f94af67526fbec52db7ebedba524067e63ab5f63a91427f5dfd3cee66dcade1d4c3f40f9fda","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Farmer's Respite","description":"An addon for the Farmer's Delight mod centered around brewing tea and coffee in the kettle","authors":["Umpaz, Probleyes"],"version":"1.20.1-2.1","icon":"C:\\Users\\Liam\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\8c11f85f9bf34938fe658c49efcfbb4e9f3810ff.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"farmersrespite-1.20.1-2.1.2.jar"},"mods\\secondchanceforge-1.20-1.5.1.jar":{"sha512":"e0284f63e209e00066d330ff38c9403c89a34fee87ea4f649d9da02b3683d4d42c0cc4f2d9a7a7aa498265ccedb253a74174e9777aadebf3b0dcac3c4de95f8d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"H6rTJkIn","slug":"second-chance-forge","project_type":"mod","team":"a9ZPFJWJ","title":"Second Chance (Forge)","description":"No more one-hit kills or accidental falls!","body":"This is a port of zoeytheegoist's Fabric mod of the same name.\n\n\nInspired by the titular ability from Kingdom Hearts, If you have 7 or more hearts of health, damage that would have originally killed you in one hit will now leave you with half a heart!

In simpler terms, it's a large mod with lots of small features, aimed at improving the vanilla game. \nEvery feature can be turned on and off individually at your will, and most features contain further options to tweak the game just how you like it.\n\nWith quark installed, the title screen will get a new \"q\" button added to it. This button allows you to configure quark from inside the game, so you can easily turn off any features you don't vibe with.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\nQuark has over a hundred different modules to play with, but here's a small highlight reel of our favorites:\n\n* Feeding Trough, for automatic animal breeding\n* Pistons Push Tile Entities, just like in Bedrock Edition\n* Japanese and Industrial style building blocks\n* Variant versions for Bookshelves, Chests, and Ladders for all wood types\n* Vertical Slabs, for all slabs already in the base game and Quark\n* Advanced Camera Mode for fancy screenshots\n* Toretoises, typo intended - new underground animals that grow ore on their back\n* Pickarang, a pickaxe that can be thrown as a boomerang\n* Trowel, a new tool to place random blocks from your hotbar, for paths or ruins\n* Emote system, allowing your character to do all sorts of motions from the chat menu\n* Reacharound Placing, which lets you place blocks under other blocks without being able to see the bottom face\n* Azalea Wood, replacing the Oak wood in Azalea trees with a pleasant green\n* Glimmering Weald, a new rare deep underground biome with glowing mushrooms and a cute new stone fae mob\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Quark today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://quarkmod.net/)**\n\n* Visit the [Old Website](https://quarkmod.net/old) (for Minecraft versions 1.12 and prior)\n* Check out [what changed](https://vazkii.notion.site/Quark-3-0-Forge-1-18-Release-Notes-f22ef705b677421585f1208156a82b44) between Quark for 1.16 and Quark for 1.18\n* Download [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), an addon focusing on more complex and technical features\n\n---\n\n# Compatibility\n\nQuark has built-in compatibility for a few mods, including JEI and TerraBlender.\n\nQuark may be incompatible with Optifine. If you are having issues using the two together, please uninstall Optifine and use a Sodium fork instead. \n\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing load crashes on 1.20.1, make sure your other mods are up to date, as any mods with integration from older versions will not function until updated.\n\n---\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T03:56:40.716482Z","updated":"2024-08-04T07:59:58.713394Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1182882,"followers":628,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["hUHoJ8IU","DWIopZ9p","z07wlDPM","MPJKDJmI","etJaVjwR","LQATRjJy","WVcMK697","e4xifKGM","NBd2DS3z","aLMcsDgH","KnCaeyy6","dNfuCJua","LrasAC1d","kDj0Fa7f","ywSMRT9e","kYMyxgpY","JThLxL7g","L9PRqT3G","Y5dUVG07","jchiLv3T","J2ikYge8","hxZ3rlaJ","4JhlPAZH","kGwG7wZ9","XV6IcdSU","ieBJd6v7","lYGV9kJO","NRZpkg7a","c7hTFL3Q","Nhn8Fatv","9ihQgCxD","qNOl7hL2","JXifdD4Q","SabfrHOJ","Vjf1btuB","8B3wEsDO","zyvZoGBo","l56EicrO","QipVljYx","htdpIhCQ","stYFI7Km","Bz5rycUV","2y7uLplb","nYJW7kfd","mxjAPHWr","ZqUi5HxP","M1mbFwiX","8po5DGR8","aKj03FLO","1d9CRYwK","sLfwgQ44","233kpcpB","a8AI08wJ","2u6IMNar","oTVxvQ9o","4vXzGj8g","85thgL6V","5WSxA94q","mTZKUEO8","yE12ipTC","NkhEAmAo","iRvSixz9","wnlS2qGl","qF1BzHnw","MYcsRA5n","RXFNcCsH","cB2bgkS0","J3etK5WK","EuOnf9qn","vIWYw2yn"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/64151f8964bc6b81d968e814bf7344bbdfad27d0.png"},"version":{"id":"vIWYw2yn","project_id":"qnQsVE2z","author_id":"kRXgk5E1","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1-4.0-460","version_number":"1.20.1-4.0-460","changelog":"https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/releases/tag/release-1.20.1-4.0-460","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-04T08:00:00.183457Z","downloads":12390,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"aebe10ece0231560aa38e269c3f46e0fe9a7e77e196054abde7fd1604b4f8b6857d03a7bd68e8983e8109431646a9df9090c32c4af2bffcfa5e4dd7efea97706","sha1":"3aef3c60a7f77e17c630df05cbb9da72d274b683"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/versions/vIWYw2yn/Quark-4.0-460.jar","filename":"Quark-4.0-460.jar","primary":true,"size":14818038,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"MVARlG2f","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"nxIuTMRv","username":"GoesBySully","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/nxIuTMRv/f4400aa9bc0120732ae57903fab324e986e726f7.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T12:53:22.188525Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"IV1Ji8se","username":"quat","name":"quaternary","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2068021?v=4","bio":"Dragon

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Developers:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; white-space: pre;\"><strong>This guide should only be used if you are a developer wanting to using Blueprint in your mod. If you're a player, you may disregard this guide.</strong><br />Adding Blueprint to your mod is quite simple! First off you need to add Blueprint as a dependency to access the library in code. To do so, add the following into your <code>build.gradle</code>: <br /><br /><code>\nrepositories {<br />\n    maven {<br />\n        url = \"https://maven.jaackson.me\"<br />\n    }<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\ndependencies {<br />\n    implementation fg.deobf(\"com.teamabnormals:blueprint:&lt;version&gt;\")<br />\n}\n      </code><br /> <br />Next you need to add it as a dependecy on Forge to make your mod require Blueprint when loading. In your <code>mods.toml</code> add the following block to the file:<br /><br /><code>\n[[dependencies.&lt;modId&gt;]]<br />\n    modId = \"blueprint\"<br />\n    mandatory = true<br />\n    versionRange = \"[&lt;version&gt;,)\"<br />\n    ordering = \"BEFORE\"<br />\n    side = \"BOTH\"\n      </code><br /><br />Replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> in the examples above with the version on you want. For example, <code>1.17.1-4.0.0</code> will give us <code>blueprint-1.17.1-4.0.0.jar</code>. The example for the <code>mods.toml</code> is targeting the version selected and any versions beyond. If you want to target it differently, you may want to read up on the <code>mods.toml</code> spec. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\"

A new portal is detected when it's created or when a player goes from the nether to the overworld.

Most JVM's should support the generator by default, but **check your logs for any warnings!**\n\nThis also patches the MC-239059 \"bug\"(which doesn't have much of an effect on the game, but is still a bug.)\n\nFaster Random's generators take more time to construct on most systems (I only have my Linux AMD system to go off of), but are much faster to generate numbers. Since minecraft re-uses many generators (meaning the construction penalty is avoided), the performance gain can vary largely.\n\n**Performance** can be tested via the testmod, which runs a benchmark against each method when run. \n\nCurrently, Faster Random **targets the slower random generators**, which creates a performance boost with world structure placement/generation, and feature + carver placement and generation, alongside a lot of client-side things like dropped items. Currently Faster Random does not do anything to the faster generators _yet_. (Until I'm sure it'll improve performance noticably and not cause more harm than good)\n\n## Should you use this mod?\n\nIt's likely that Faster Random will only improve worldgen performance up to a certain extent, as **you'll quickly hit a RAM and I/O bottleneck from the increased amount of chunks stored in RAM/being written to disk.** This isn't a bad thing, this just means that you're generating chunks faster than the rest of your system can store them. Depending on your system, your mileage may vary greatly.\n\nAs a result, this mod provides the most performance in situations where **the server thread(s) are CPU bottlenecked** (singleplayer runs on an internal server), but have access to a decent amount of fast memory and storage (DDR4 RAM, and a SATA III or better HDD).\n\nFor world generation, Faster Random is _almost_ 1:1, but **some cave shapes will generate differently to Vanilla.** Everything else is 1:1. It's likely that these differences will be unnoticiable, but shouldn't be used for parity-sensitive things like speedrunning. **Optifine's math optimizations do far more damaging changes to worldgen than Faster Random.**\n\nFaster Random does not need to be on both the client and server. Faster Random can provide a small performance boost client-side, as quite a few things are still random there.\n\n## System Requirements (3.0.0+)\n- A JVM that [fully supports Java 17's new `RandomGenerator` system](https://gist.github.com/AnOpenSauceDev/36719f1ed2770fa0094d6be618b137e3), **and implementations of the [LXM generators alongside it](https://openjdk.org/jeps/356)**. (example: [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org )). **Having an unsupported JVM will disable Faster Random,** and will require you to use Faster Random 1.6.0. If your JVM doesn't support this, chances are it's not a good JVM.\n\n(**Note:** You may be unknowingly using a headless JDK for Minecraft, which breaks Faster Random due to a variety of strange reasons. Please check if you have downloaded the correct JDK/Package if Faster Random is crashing.)\n\n## Usage with other mods\n\nFaster Random should work well with a large variety of mods, especially after 4.0.0.\n\nFaster Random also **can perform better alongside other terrain optimization mods such as Noisium and C2ME**, thanks to them making better leverage of Minecraft's random systems with multithreading. **Ideally,** you should use Noisium + Faster Random, and throw as much ram (10GB+) as you can spare at Minecraft when using Distant Horizons (C2ME has a performance hit with DH). Faster Random can leverage Noisium for a significant reduction in CPU usage from world generation.\n\n## Forge?\n\n[**Francium**](https://modrinth.com/mod/francium-optimization) is an _unofficial_ forge variant for **1.16 and 1.18**, which mostly does what Faster Random does, albeit **without the worldgen optimizations.** For 1.20.1 and these worldgen changes, [**Sinytra Connector**](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) should be able to run the mod with a \"stable enough\" experience. For 1.20.1+, you can try using the NeoForge port.\n\n\nFaster Random's Icon is licensed under **CC-BY-SA**. Code is licensed under **Apache 2.0**.\n\nLike this mod?

Astronomy","description":"Draw your own constellations on an interactive and improved night sky.\nAn immersive overhaul of the space skybox, including planets and better stars.","body":"# Spyglass Astronomy\nExplore a procedurally generated solar system through the lens of a spyglass!\n\nThe mod is entirely client-side and designed for helping with world-building and immersion, it is encouraged you think of lore about all the constellations you draw and planets you name!\n\nPlanets and stars will be the same for all players on a particular world, and are generated randomly (and largely scientifically accurately) per world, and you can easily share constellations between players using a client-side command\n\nThe scientific accuracy means the underlying physics of astrology (orbital resonance, alignments, etc) work exactly the same, you just have to spot them and make up your own lore!\n\n![Screenshot of some planets and constellations from atop a mountain](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EdBSdqge/images/3dc17c154655fdc2dc7fc3989a38e16e9052d269.png)\n\n## Dependencies:\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (or the Quilt equivalent, although i have not tested this mod with Quilt)\n\n# How to use\n\nTo interact with the cosmos there are three spyglass modes: vanilla, constellation (amethyst), and star (emerald), these are cycled with the pick block button (middle click) while zoomed in.\n\nConstellation mode allows you to draw constellations by holding the attack button (left click) and drawing between stars, as well as being able to select constellations\n\nStar mode allows you to select stars and planets, note that comets are referred to as *planets* when using commands\n\nOnce an object is selected you can name it with `/sga:name <name>`, or get useful information with `/sga:info`, you can also get the information of a specific object without selecting it by following the suggestions after typing `/sga:info <x>`\n\nIf you're playing on a multiplayer server, you can use `/sga:share` or `/sga:share <x>` to share the currently selected or specified object respectively, this gives you a code you can send in chat or /message to someone directly, which allows them to easily add a constellation or name of a planet or star on their side, provided they have the mod too, of course.\n\nAll the client-side commands can be seen by looking at the suggestions after typing `/sga:`, or by looking at the list on [the github readme](https://github.com/Nettakrim/Spyglass-Astronomy/blob/master/README.md)\n\nThere is also [a client+server mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/almanac-for-spyglass-astronomy) that allows for bulk sharing, it's made by someone else, but it looks good!\n\n*Older versions of Spyglass Astronomy are incompatible with the mod [Spyglass Improvements](https://modrinth.com/mod/spyglass-improvements), however Spyglass Astronomy comes with its own scrollable spyglass zoom, and other mods, like [Zoomglass](https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomglass), exist to allow for spyglass hotkeys*","published":"2023-01-13T18:55:51.761568Z","updated":"2024-06-27T13:44:41.486522Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":283417,"followers":538,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":["adventure","equipment","game-mechanics","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["nI4qp7Mu","xOfNbmQ6","1WFJg9bP","BrAcU4L5","qfDQznp8","Ci1dC3Dn","xhSNfbzV","kQznCan3","2PqIF29B","dAsbYV9J","cLqZKIoC","aUuB0C1I","549FJ0re","jtV94niq","4VNDz5WH","bc2bKIkB","VV52KDNg","kZJY3885","lUMJvYpW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EdBSdqge/c3683238ee4b794847a1987dfe36feca07aca670.png"},"version":{"id":"lUMJvYpW","project_id":"EdBSdqge","author_id":"GEHjanYT","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1

If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue (select the **Report a bug** template).\n\nCheck out my new OptiGUI resource pack for Minecraft 1.19+: [Chest Boat GUI](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/chest-boat-gui)\n\n[![BisectHosting banner](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/a661d818-b1af-427c-9754-12e8b243fd60.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/opekope2)\n\n## How to use it\n\n1. Download and install [Fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) or [Quilt loader](https://quiltmc.org/en/install)\n2. Download this mod from your [favorite service](#optigui)\n3. Download the required dependencies as well\n4. Put this mod in your mods folder\n\n## Resource pack docs\n\nOptiGUI supports OptiFine custom GUI resource packs, and also supports OptiGUI resource packs. OptiGUI resource packs are more flexible than OptiFine resource packs.\nSee documentation link above to get started.\n\n## Supported resource packs\n\nExcluding vanilla resource packs (which don't container OptiFine or OptiGUI-specific files)\n\n* [Colourful Containers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-gui/)\n* [Colourful Containers Add-On](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/updated-colourful-containers-light-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Colourful Containers Dark Mode](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-dark-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Animated RGB GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/optifine-animated-rgb-gui) ¹\n* [NEON20 ANIMATED](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/neon20-animated-optifine/)\n* [Rybo's Enhanced GUI](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/rybo-s-enhanced-gui/)\n* [Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/animated-fox-guis-1-16-x/) ¹\n* [\\[DARK\\] Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fox-4931933/) ¹\n\n¹ see FAQ for animation support\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. If you know a resource pack which works, and you'd like to see it here, or a resource pack, which does not work, but works with OptiFine, please open an issue.\n\n## Partially supported resource packs\n\nExcluding vanilla resource packs (which don't container OptiFine or OptiGUI-specific files)\n\n* [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) ¹\n\n¹ Barrel does not work, neither does it work with OptiFine. The resource pack does not specify it according to the format.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Use in a modpack?\n\nYes.\n\n### OptiFine GUI animations?\n\nOnly with [Animatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/animatica).\n\n### OptiFine colors (colors.properties)?\n\nNo, use [Colormatic](https://modrinth.com/mod/colormatic).\n\n### Performance impact?\n\nOptiGUI's performance impact is negligible (tho it varies a bit depending on which resource packs are used).\n\n### Configuration GUI/file?\n\nNothing to configure.\n\n### Sodium?\n\nYes.\n\n### OptiFine?\n\nActually, OptiGUI and OptiFine (with OptiFabric) **can** be loaded simultaneously.\nI have observed that OptiGUI mixins will be placed before OptiFine ones, so you can turn off custom GUIs in OptiFine to save performance.\n\nHowever, I can't assist you with this.\n\n### Supported loaders?\n\nFabric & Quilt.

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.","published":"2022-09-19T17:04:44.140047Z","updated":"2024-08-17T19:49:11.397700Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":679751,"followers":437,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["qjPNxjeI","QY3g1MPa","6Y4CdZNa","ruVouh8N","fwWMS64D","Ef4UURAJ","cNuQKeYa","bEkfuXFS","azj5HSxy","pGWBRn1i","g54fQTVc","oDqrlOkT","NjDgCyxY","VXixoSQM","UF8erTuU","Ucep0Cu5","VFPcEpGA","KYboqMGf","X1F0kcns","QCPx2IS2","LvVX8D1q","7xq1zpn0","DkP5RdK3","2YI9I4TO","EDsEsJtK","aJk5QhXt","u2ibYGVH","2Ae8EJZw","WOCP3kLf","oSQPSvZH","pzCkMdkj","h13cp5Hk","SzaC8Y3W","JrSJCgLX","qiJtKPOI","kJTOmZiq","4Kt64z82","RkJWufMO","Osxa4mmc","URzpc7Lq","ouVfwhi4","JkgJLz6x","b64nmuue","jsIwSe6h","B7ZtSwe2","iG0xPWUm","vOu5WIvs","bOQ2Cikd","mSQJJvNy","91FfnPM8","UQb9qD3J","XTopJ0Id","deyBZlUs","vaBqHK19","ljjcUkWs","81E06FMa","1QeyH5IG","8Q03X6HA","Aj08MYtw","PSEQMV1l","DYKVvo9P","js1pLjSF","slz81V0J","MzRHyyTC","gLzlXMlf","NP7Nwrwq","vdae5kTA","QiWlD1U9","hJQhKVxj","RBDMFemm","EXGDg1mc","ZFOUucav","tOGQOc87","GKj5mumX","KnHNGyLj","buCwQh9G","LNxSmECr","GmitzqXs","NhqiKzjd","Iu7dNK5J","S9W5W5gZ","n5c0ilso","yr87igvi","soyzSn1W","eVyBNuwl","cIHoyOhg","Btqy2YLV","FwTldg5l","8Zv39qno","jHvKJkv8","rwRYD8bX","ofN9RHSY","532t65Zz","FyOp03FS","sMyWCvwn","j2OvzNhM","9kp2Pvcp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/ec708f6b60ed75fceab14e0848e9906f99dd84e1.png"},"version":{"id":"532t65Zz","project_id":"wGKYL7st","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.3.3+1.20.1","version_number":"1.3.3+1.20.1-forge","changelog":"# 1.3.3\n\n- Fix roll charges even when paused #45\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-13T21:12:26.844144Z","downloads":1164,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0839e7b1a83dcc7a5eb42824d46ca4544a3f4ac376bd12a85509da00ae2737d836aaebf6fed6d2aa05ebcd816cff26dc3febe3b32f531b3ca3814ba2ade9c782","sha1":"4ff92ecd8df9b5a280330f68ef9c7a8a2300b23f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/versions/532t65Zz/combatroll-forge-1.3.3%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"combatroll-forge-1.3.3+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":217962,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gedNE4y2","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oKdlkn0S","user":{"id":"CUHgJfv9","username":"ZsoltMolnarrr","name":"Molnár Zsolt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4989469?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T18:48:27.207892Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"combatroll-forge-1.3.3+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\borderless-mining-1.1.8+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"ca30d3fea6cae4c206789d7461edeedfb294a96e5eaebf60075baf3326e1021979cd94e29ade9096f25bfeb8cb36b6c6659d480ad24b1572c0c79efc6ee5e420","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kYq5qkSL","slug":"borderless-mining","project_type":"mod","team":"JlzYybVB","title":"Borderless Mining","description":"Changes Fullscreen to use a borderless window.","body":"Borderless Mining changes the fullscreen option to use a borderless window that fills the screen.

This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

for Fabric/Quilt. It allows players to zoom, change and hold perspectives, have custom textures on named/random entities, take panoramic screenshots, and use super secret settings!\n\n## Dependencies\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) or [Quilted Fabric API (QFAPI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)\n    - `fabric-resource-loader-v0`\n    - `fabric-key-binding-api-v1`\n    - `fabric-rendering-v1`\n    - `fabric-lifecycle-events-v1`\n- Java 21 or later.\n\n## FAQ\n- **Can I add my own shader to Super Secret Settings?**\n    - Yes! You can add more shaders using resource packs.\n        - **Do you have a guide for this?**\n            - I recommend checking out the [Souper Secret Settings: Resourcepack Guide](https://github.com/Nettakrim/Souper-Secret-Settings/blob/main/ResourcepackGuide/ResourcepackGuide.md).\n                - Perspective specific documentation is not yet available.\n    - Perspective is cross-compatible with [Souper Secret Settings](https://modrinth.com/mod/souper-secret-settings), meaning resource packs made for either mod will work!\n- **Is Perspective compatible with other mods?**\n  - We try to be as compatible as possible, but sometimes things break.\n    - If you find an incompatible mod, let us know!\n  - We are cross-compatible with Souper Secret Settings' resource packs, and our shaders can run alongside Iris Shaders.\n- **Can I use this in a modpack or video?**\n    - Yes, you can use this mod in modpacks or videos.\n- **Will you port this mod to 1.x.x?**\n    - I am unlikely to port to specific versions, but I do try to keep up to date with the latest Minecraft version. However, other developers are free to port this mod, as long as they adhere to the conditions of the LGPL-3.0-or-later license.\n- **Is this compatible with Forge?**\n    - No. However, other developers are free to port this mod, as long as they adhere to the conditions of the LGPL-3.0-or-later license.\n- **Is this compatible with Quilt Loader?**\n    - Yes, currently Perspective is developed and built for Fabric Loader, with Quilt Loader compatibility in mind.\n        - Fabric Loader support may get dropped in favour of Quilt Loader at a future date.\n- **Why are some keybinding(s) not working?**\n    - Make sure there are no conflicts with any keybinding(s).\n        - `Load Hoatbar Activator` and `Save Hotbar Activator` may be conflicting by default.\n\n## Also check out\n[Souper Secret Settings](https://modrinth.com/mod/souper-secret-settings) by Nettakrim  \n[Luminance Mod Collection](https://modrinth.com/collection/VB5x1hBs)  \n\n#\nLicensed under LGPL-3.0-or-later.\n\n**This mod is not affiliated with/endorsed by Mojang Studios or Microsoft.**  \nSome game assets are property of Mojang Studios and fall under Minecraft EULA.","published":"2023-06-01T04:10:26.047964Z","updated":"2024-08-17T05:12:07.741858Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":7134,"followers":41,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["cursed"],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2","23w40a","23w41a","23w42a","23w43a","23w43b","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["gQEbf1Xp","S09CTVM2","x2ZTC5h1","XT0n34xk","wlTSs1mE","Q2UF4MLL","4vHs0ui1","aeNfNaTE","NJUdjCwz","b2lIRpcd","Cez9Vdfs","2TQcIgk1","z5E5W2UF","mDPESNSk","YLrV7ykR","Teia7L98","GYolnxmR","GbsKnncB","Z4tQk4x9","mA3nIMCj","B3VfkN3P","HUsyJ8ep","lbFKDsxK","cTcB7QrV","fCjIrvYF","oA85EQme","tvHkB00R","NfQSIOxE","4P3Lyurp","e4lNa0dc","ytY7WgnL","QBSBnI7K","F7DNZWuN","bsgzdEWa","3RPOQRXw","AbDNfsEc","yioaPplb","zvWOkIqP","nayjZVHT","kofK716q","xcUV7cqr","8JRIpGI4","KsdK8gQV","TZHFriz8","Gx59jJSx","IK86rZ72","OKnyxWtA","m1scu6Nj","uK36Xyro","qKLt1JhR","oX2giunP","rLd5vU4p","W5tZ7Z1Y","7UjaDAFj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6CTGnrNg/4141560459cef5ec79f61ab02c3104d589773047.png"},"version":{"id":"ytY7WgnL","project_id":"6CTGnrNg","author_id":"ZY1tZdVF","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.0-1] Perspective 1.2.0-alpha.2","version_number":"1.2.0-alpha.2+1.20.0-1","changelog":"# Perspective 1.2.0-alpha.2 for 1.20 and 1.20.1  \n\nThis version requires a minecraft version between **1.20 and 1.20.1**, This release will **NOT** work on previous or newer versions.  \n\n## Changelog  \n- Ported to 1.20-1.20.1  \n- Instant Zoom now uses getZoomMultiplier()  \n\n## Found a bug?  \nReport it on the [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/MCLegoMan/Perspective/issues).

world, so playtime will be displayed for existing worlds that were created without the mod as well.\nThe mod is *client-side* only, and does nothing on the server-side.\n\n![World Play Time -

These ores, when applied to a tool or armour-piece on a Smithing Table, bestow an Enchantment!\nUsing further Enchanting Ores on the same piece of equipment will up the enchantment level, too.\nThe 10 ores are:\n\n## Overworld\n\n### Fire Ruby ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/1jXPMdp.png)\n- Grants Flame, Fire Aspect, or Fire Protection, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under desert biomes.\n\n### Ice Sapphire ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/oqdZZp3.png)\n- Grants Frost Walker, Freezing, or Snowpiercer dependent on the item. Most commonly found under icy biomes.\n\n### Spirit Garnet ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/0Jr6rwc.png)\n- Grants Thorns, Leeching, or Loyalty, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under extremely hilly biomes.\n\n### Haste Peridot ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/kgE9LCJ.png)\n- Grants Efficiency, Quick Draw, or Lure, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under jungle biomes.\n\n### Lucky Citrine ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/5yAwgQ1.png)\n- Grants Fortune, Looting, or Luck of the Sea, dependent on the item.

Most commonly found under ocean biomes.\n\n## Nether\n\n### Power Pyrite ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/dEYct8K.png)\n- Grants Power (of course), Sharpness, or Stonebreaker, dependent on the item. Most commonly found in the Nether Wastes.\n\n### Heart Rhodonite ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/1gcTxQz.png)\n- Grants Heartfelt, which can be applied to all armour pieces. Most commonly found in the Soul Sand Valley.\n\n### Kinetic Opal ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/pIyTV79.png)\n- Grants Blast Protection, Smelting, or Runner, dependent on the item. Most commonly found in the Basalt Deltas.\n\n## End\n\n### Malachite Meteorite\n- A meteorite made of two new blocks, Malacrust and Malacore. Contains Air Malachite Ore floating within.\n\n### Air Malachite ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/CvsTdjn.png)\n- Grants Feather Falling, Knight Jump, or Floatation, dependent on the item. Most commonly found beyond the End Islands.\n\n![Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/869923659819679755/898323641756958740/Mining_Master_Showcase.png)\n\n## Enchantments\n\nWe've added several new Enchantments that cannot be obtained in an Enchanting Table to flesh out some of these gems more, providing a greater incentive to mine them!\n\n- Leeching - Swords and Axes. 25% of any critical damage dealt is restored back to the attacker as health on-hit.\n\n- Freezing - Swords, Axes, Bows and Crossbows. Inflicts slowness and Criticals fire enemies.\n\n- Snowpiercer - Leggings. Grants Speed when running on Snow and Ice blocks.\n\n- Grace - Chestplates. Grants you the Dolphins Grace effect for a short amount of time, after which it will wear off and only activate again after having dried off on land. Pairs well with Depth Strider...\n\n- Stonebreaker - Pickaxes. Destroys Stone, Cobblestone, Diorite, Granite, Andesite, and Netherrack, leaving no drops.\n\n- Heartfelt - All Armours. Increases your maximum health by one heart per level. Damage each armour piece proportionally increases.\n\n- Smelting - Pickaxes and Shovels. Smelts mined ore blocks! Must be paired with Silk Touch to mine Nether Gold Ore.\n\n- Runner - Boots. Increases your sprinting speed.\n\n- Knight Jump - Leggings. Gives you an additional mid-air jump per level.\n\n- Floatation - Bows and Crossbows. Inflicts enemies with Levitation.\n\n## Gem Forge\n\nEarly on, you may find the Smithing Table method of enchanting to be enough. Once you attain Blackstone, though, you can take things to the next level.\n\nThe Gem Forge allows you to melt down your gems and imbue your Diamond tools and armour with the gems' very essence, creating Supra tools that are stronger than Diamond! (But not Netherite.) Some Supra tools contain over-levelled enchantments, and even when they don't, they just look cool, so what's not to love?\n(The forging noises are also amazing, thank you for that Ludo <3)\n\nIf that's not enough for you though, you can take things even further... Using various different gems, you can craft the Ultima toolset to absolutely dominate the competition!\nThey may not be fireproof like Netherite, but they all sure pack quite the punch!\n\nSimilarly, you can create the ultimate armour-set through a similar method. Unlock the true power of Minecraft's movement capabilities with the Paragon Armour!\n\n![Image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763136094463590400/966112268314112040/unknown.png)\n\n## Advancements\n\nWant to be a completionist? We went ahead and implemented our very own advancements! Check out the unique page we made for them in-game :D Lots of Sonic references, heheh!\n\n## Config & Compatibility\n\n### Generation\n\nYou can disable the 'spawning' of any gem ore you personally don't want to see in the game!\nAdditionally, you can customize the specific spawn rates of each category of gem.\n'Common Gems' are the gems we have determined as being less desirable than the 'Rare Gems'. Rubies, Sapphires, Garnets, Aquamarines and Pyrites are Common, whilst Peridots, Citrines, Rhodonites, and Opals are Rare. 'Random Gems' are simply gems that generate regardless of their native biome.\n\n### Enchantments & Datapacks\n\nRelease 3 changes the enchantments the gems give from hardcoded to malleable JSON recipes. You know what that means?\n\nThe selection of enchantments each gem gives is entirely customizable via datapacks! This also means the gems can give other mod's enchantments, too! You can add or remove as many enchantments to/from each gem as you see fit!\n\n(Also, what blocks Snowpiercer and Stonebreaker work on in addition to what enemies are dealt critical damage from Freezing are held in tags, so you can edit those too if you so wish! Check the Data folder on GitHub for more!)\n\n### Just Enough Items, Enchantment Descriptions, Neko's Enchanted Books\n\nAlthough it has its own recipe book, Gem Forge recipes can also be quickly previewed through the Just Enough Items mod! Thanks, Swan! You can also find out what each Enchantment does in-game via the Creative Mode-exclusive Enchanted Books with Enchantment Descriptions installed. Those books all gain unique sprites with Neko's Enchanted Books!\n\n### Known incompatibility issues:\n\nSpartan Weaponry - Due to the mod being closed-source, we unfortunately can't work towards fixing the issue ourselves.\n\n### If you make any videos on it or add it to your modpacks, please let us know! We're extremely proud of this mod, and we greatly hope you enjoy playing with it!\n\n![Image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/764954649152323614/906294131381387274/unknown.png)\n\n#

To be more precise, it is not an additional mod for Craft Tweaker, but simply adds a visual editor to the game and automatic code generation in Zen Script.\n\nIt is very easy to use this mod, it is enough to install the mod on the server and client, if desired, you can install Craft Tweaker for ease of development, but this is optional. Thanks to this, you can start creating your own recipes for assembly even before the official release of Craft Tweaker on this version. Thus, the recipes will not work in the game, but when the craft tweaker is installed, they will all work.\n\nAfter installing JCTGUI and CT on the server and client, you can start creating the first recipe. To do this, open the chat and register the beginning of the command \"/ctgui\" and press the space bar. Then you will have several options for crafting blocks. At the moment, only \"crafting_table\" is supported and press the space bar. Next, you need to select an action. At the moment, you can only \"open\". As a result, our command should look something like this before executing: **/ctgui crafting_table create**\n\nThen we will open the GUI itself. Before opening, take the items from which you want to craft into your inventory. When the GUI is open, you can see an interface similar to crafting table, in which you need to lay out the recipe. Creating using items from other mods is possible, but errors may occur. When you have posted your recipe, you can click the Generate button to generate Zen Script code. The generated code will appear in your chat and you can check it for errors if you understand this language. Then you can click the Save button and the recipe will be automatically saved to the Scripts folder called generated1.zs. It is not possible to choose the name of the recipe and file manually yet, and this happens automatically.\n\nNow that the recipe has been created, you need to update the list of Craft Tweaker recipes. This can be done by logging back into minecraft or by running the command below: **/reload**\n\n<h3>A little history of creation and plans for the future.</h3>\n\nThis mod was created by me for myself and was supposed to help me create my minecraft builds, but soon a bug occurred, because of which I could not continue development. And today, as I write this, I fixed this bug and improved the code generation mechanism.\n\nHere are some plans for the future and a roadmap for the development of the mod, the elements in it are distributed according to the degree of importance and complexity of implementation:\n\nThe Todo list can be found here: https://github.com/300f20t/Just-CTGUI/issues/3\n\nMy discord server: https://discord.gg/y3xkvMrYt6\n\n_-This mod is not maintained or supported by the the creators of  Craft Tweaker._","published":"2023-08-05T04:44:18.273316Z","updated":"2024-08-06T23:03:29.509906Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":3265,"followers":26,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.16.5","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["o2pkBLeG","A3Xj51rm","vTLT5fUK","THV6VxLQ","IhXTQTRh","jlaSNzbw","3HUPy0C1","qfJzqa91","IQ50sCxy","yy2nAUjp","6zvJFxUv","YE7xprvM","L9ChGjY0","nAXIZbG3","Y0IItwIN","sW8xFxky","XGC1WzPq","KVggXNN5","8BICqZ9l","6P2ZYsDf","Iz1y69QT","qLz3yfMB","tZWFj4r5","wZKsYvva","GKvqDJEJ","ZO39JcSh","CZLysqKq","3jjrG639","wT5i7IaN","VatHGpni","vv4okXK1","RjZO8MA3","m1BA34BO","CBKD92ZM","j1W9ngOy","cCNCNPBf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uQorKjjW/a06451d7d462d6edad25a84e59b515bf7038de8b.png"},"version":{"id":"CBKD92ZM","project_id":"uQorKjjW","author_id":"4tbGGrq5","featured":false,"name":"Just CTGUI 0.1.6","version_number":"0.1.6","changelog":"Mirror recipes have been fixed.

Not only have we expanded the amount of mobs in vanilla Minecraft that can be tamed, but we have also fixed several problems with these mobs, added new items and blocks to improve the tamed mob experience, and have introduced a new Pet Enchanting system. Asides from the new command system, most of these changes should be reflected in both mobs from vanilla and new tamed mobs introduced in other mods, like [Alex's Mobs](https://modrinth.com/mod/alexs-mobs).\n\n\nWith Domestication Innovation installed, no more will your pets have to sit out battles, exploration and more at home. Now they can join the fun without worry of permanently loosing them, or them being completely outclassed by other mobs and mods.\n\nFeature Breakdown:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Wander, Stay, Follow</summary>\n\nWolves, Cats, Parrots, Axolotls, Rabbits, and Foxes now have 3 possible states when tamed: Wander, Stay and Follow. These can be cycled through by right clicking on the mob. Now its finally possible to have your cats and dogs wander around your house instead of being frozen in place or randomly teleport to you. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Swing Through Pets</summary>\n\nUnless sneaking, the swing of your sword, fist, or any attack will pass right through any tamed pets of yours. They will hit any possible mob behind the pet as well. This means you are free to get in the battle with your pets without fear of hurting them! This change applies to arrows and other projectiles as well. If you do want to hurt the tamed mob, you can hold sneak during the attack. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n \n<details>\n<summary>Sweeping Edge Changes</summary>\n\nSweeping edge can now no longer hurt any tamed pets of yours.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Axolotls</summary>\n\nGone are the days of weirdly holding a tropical fish bucket if you want to use an Axolotl as a companion: These amphibians are now fully tameable! Simply feed a wild axolotl a few tropical fish to tame them. They can be made to sit, wander and follow like all the other tameable mobs. Note that axolotls are by default very slow on land, dry out and have low health - you have been warned. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n <details>\n<summary>Tameable Foxes</summary>\n\nTrustable mobs have always been somewhat scuffed in implementation. Thankfully, we've made it so that tamed foxes are actually tamed - and can be made to sit, wander and follow like the other pets. To get a tame fox, you need to breed two wild foxes with sweet berries and wait for it to grow up. Note that no matter how tame foxes are, they'll still want to kill any chickens and (untamed) rabbits they can see. This feature is configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Rabbits</summary>\n\nWhen they were initially added to the game, rabbits were fully tameable just like cats and wolves. However, this was eventually removed. We've undone this change and made them like the other tamable mobs above. To tame a rabbit, feed it several Hay Bales. Rabbits only have 3 health by default and usually (see: Sinister Carrot) cannot attack. However, to make them useful we have reintroduced another removed feature: rabbits scare off ravagers. Both them being tameable and the scaring of ravagers are configurable.\n\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Tameable Frogs</summary>\n\nLots of people have frogs as pets in the real world... right? Now you can tame them in Minecraft with a few spider eyes. Frogs can be made to stay, follow or wander like the other pets, and will come to their owner's defense. They may have low attack and health, but they sure make up for it in cuteness.\n\n</details>\n\n \n<details>\n<summary>Pet Beds</summary>\n\nPet Beds are new craftable blocks that are made like so:\n\n![Pet Bed Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/KPuMzoc.png)\n\nNote that they come in all 16 colors.\n\nBy moving one of your tamed mobs onto a pet bed, you enable it to respawn there the next morning if it somehow dies. The visual indication for this is if you see a bunch of ZZZ particles appear above your pet's head: this means it has set its respawn point. To remove the respawn point, simply break the bed block.\n\nMobs can only respawn at dawn, so if your pet dies some other time you will have to wait until then to see it again. Pet enchants are preserved with respawning, but more on that later.\nThe respawning of mobs in beds is configurable.\n\n\n</details>\n \n<details>\n<summary>Wayward Lantern</summary>\n\nThe Wayward Lantern is a decorative block that can be crafted from iron ingots and a lantern. If you are ever so far away from your pets in 'follow' mode that they are unloaded from the world, they will eventually find their way back to the closest Wayward Lantern to you. This makes it perfectly fine to die far from home and not loose both your pets and your loot.\n![Wayward Lantern Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/DxNMqzo.png)\n![Wayward Lantern](https://i.imgur.com/vyGTkiF.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Feather on a Stick</summary>\n\nFeather on a Stick is a new simple tool crafted like so:\n![Feather on a Stick Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/P3LFZcE.png)\n\nWhen used, this will send out a feather on a string in front of you. The closest pet of yours will then try to move onto the feather to play with it. This tool is useful for getting your mob out of places it shouldn't be, like if it's stuck in a doorway or on top of a chest. It's also useful for moving a pet onto its bed so you can set its respawn point.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Rotten Apple & Sinister Carrot</summary>\n\nRotten Apples have a chance to form if an apple item despawns on the ground (configurable). These green, wormy apples can be fed to a horse in order to turn it into a zombie horse. Note that you'll want to make sure the horse is tamed and saddled prior to this action. This zombification process will also preserve the speed and other aspects of the horse. Zombie horses cannot wear armor.\n\nSinister Carrots are rarely found as loot in Woodland Mansions (configurable). They can be fed to a zombie horse in order to turn it into a skeleton horse. They can also be fed to a tamed rabbit to transform it into a Killer Rabbit, which can attack and is much stronger than a normal rabbit.\n\n</details>\n \n<details>\n<summary>Animal Tamer Villager</summary>\n\nAnimal Tamers can be found in villages in their own unique houses (spawn rate configurable) or can be created with a unemployed villager using a pet bed as a workstation. They trade a variety of items related to animals from both vanilla minecraft and this mod, including unique pet enchants(charisma). Their houses also contain some untamed mobs and sometimes fish tanks.\n\nThe Animal Tamer villager can be disabled via the config.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Deed of Ownership</summary>\n\nThe Deed of Ownership is an item that can be purchased from the Animal Tamer villager. By right clicking on a tamed pet that you are the owner of, you bind it to the deed. If you give the deed to any other player, and they use it on the bounded animal, then the ownership of the pet will pass onto them, making it effectively as if they were the ones who tamed the animal.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Command Drum</summary>\n\nThe Command Drum block has been added to automate commanding groups of mobs via redstone. Craft it like so:\n\n![Drum Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/yiCKvad.png)\n\nWhen interacted with, the drum will beat and change command modes, whilst ordering all tamed mobs of the user to follow, stay or wander depending on the beat. If given a redstone signal, it will command the mobs of the player that originally placed the block. The block also makes a funny sound if you jump on it.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Collar Tags</summary>\n\nCollar Tags are the conduit for pet enchantments. They can be crafted like so:\n![Collar Tag Recipe](https://i.imgur.com/xf0lLlf.png)\n\nLike a nametag, these collar tags can be renamed in an anvil and used on a mob to rename it (unlike a nametag, this is only for animals that are your pets). However, their real use is that they can be enchanted (configurable).\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Enchanting Your Pets</summary>\n\nPets can be enchanted by applying enchants to a collar tag in either an anvil or an enchanting table.\n\n![Enchanting a collar tag](https://i.imgur.com/gytL7ov.gif)\n\n\nThese collars can then be placed on a tamed pet of yours by interacting with it. To get the enchanted collar back, you can simply swap it with any other collar, including an unenchanted one. You can view a pet's enchants by sneaking and looking at them.\n\n![Enchanted Wolf](https://i.imgur.com/eA9swxP.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>All Pet Enchantments</summary>\n\n35 Pet Enchantments are added, including 4 curses and 5 loot/trade exclusive enchantments. These are:\n\n- Health Boost I-III : Pet gains 10 additional maximum health per level.\n- Fireproof : Pet cannot be damaged by fire or lava.\n- Immunity Frame I-III : Pet gains immunity frames (1 second for each level) after attacked, donated by an energy barrier overlay. While active, pet will not be damaged further during this time.\n- Deflecting : Pet is protected by a ghostly shield which deflects any projectile attacks.\n- Poison Resistance : Pet cannot be inflicted with poison effect.\n- Chain Lightning I-II : When attacking, Pet shoots lightning that arcs from the target to nearby mobs. Perfect for dealing with swarms of mobs like zombies. Level determines amount of mobs the lightning arcs between.\n- Speedster I-III : Increases pets movement speed.\n- Frost Fang : Inflicts attack targets with frozen effect (ie. powdered snow effect) that slows them and damages them over time\n- Magnetic : Pet is aided by a ghostly magnet which pulls attack targets closer to it.\n- Linked Inventory : Pet can pick up items and teleport them to its owners inventory.\n- Total Recall : When below 2 health, pet enters a recall orb and is protected from any further damage until released by its owner.\n- Health Siphon : Transfers any incoming damage from the pet to its owner, if nearby.\n- Bubbling I-II : Pet attacks trap target inside a giant bubble which floats upwards and pops, sending the target plummeting to the ground. Level determines duration of the bubble. Only found as loot in Buried Treasure.\n- Herding I-II : Pet can be followed by untamed animals. Level determines maximum amount of followers.\n- Amphibious : Pet cannot dry out (if aquatic like axolotls) or drown (if a land animal) in water or on land. Improves movement underwater and allows land animals to properly swim instead of splashing at the top of the water.\n- Vampire's Familiar I-II : Pet regains a portion of health for each successful attack. Level I is 50% of the attack, level II is 100%. Only found as loot in Woodland Mansions.\n- Void Cloud : If pet falls off a cliff or into the void, a cloud will be summoned to lift it back up and towards its owner, if nearby. Only found as loot in End Cities.\n- Charisma I-III : Lowers trade prices if near owner. Level determines how great of a deal is given. Only given as a trade by villagers.\n- Shadow Hands I-IV : Pet gains dark magical abilities in the form of shadow hands that emerge from the creature. These hands deal melee damage at a decent range. Level determines count and speed of hands when attacking.\n- Disc Jockey : Pet is followed by a magical jukebox that can play any record on loop.\n- Defusal I-III : Pet will nullify any nearby explosion, such as from creepers or TNT. Level determines range of effect.\n- Warping Bite : Pet will teleport target away from itself when attacking.\n- Ore Scenting I-III : Pet will occasionally sniff out local ores and highlight them to nearby players. Level determines frequency, range and amount of ores highlighted. Only found as loot in Abandoned Mineshafts.\n- Gluttonous : This pet can eat any food if low on health to heal, ignoring dietary restrictions and negative effects of the food.\n- Psychic Wall I-III : This pet can summon a psychic wall of energy between its owner and any close monsters during combat. This wall will stop any unfriendly entity from walking through it. Level determines size of wall, length and frequency of the effect.\n- Intimidation I-II : This pet can occasionally scare all nearby monsters away from it. Level determines frequency and range.\n- Tethered Teleport : This pet will automatically teleport with you whenever you do when following. That includes through portals, via commands, ender pearls and more.\n- Muffled : This pet will not emit sound or vibrations. Only found as loot in Ancient Cities.\n- Blazing Protection I-III : This pet is surrounded by multiple (2 per level) blaze bars, which absorb incoming damage and ignite attackers. Only found as loot in Nether Fortresses.\n- Healing Aura I-II : When this pet or its allies are injured, it will create a circle of regeneration around itself, healing nearby mobs.\n- Rejuvenation : This pet can absorb experience orbs when injured to convert to health points.\n- Curse of Afterlife : If pet is slain, a hostile, zombifed version of it appears, with all the enchants and abilities of its past life.\n- Curse of Infamy : Pet attracts attention from nearby monsters, which will begin targeting it.\n- Curse of Blight : Random flowers, crops, grass blocks, etc. will wither and die occasionally when this pet is near.\n- Curse of Immaturity : Pet appears as a baby animal version of itself, and deals less damage when attacking.\n\n\nMost of these enchants are not compatible with each other and have varying levels of occurrence. See the chart below:\n![enchantment chart](https://i.imgur.com/6sXKEjV.png)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>A Word on Mod Compatibility</summary>\n\nThe Wander, Stay and Follow command system is implemented for vanilla mobs only. It is up to other mods to develop a similar system for their mobs.\n\nHowever, all other features of the mod like the pet beds and enchants should work with any tameable mob in other mods.\nEnchants from this mod are compatible with Enchantment Descriptions.\nMobs from Alex's Mobs should spawn by default inside some of the Animal Tamer's cages in villages.\nIf you are a mod dev and want to make sure Domestication Innovation works out of the box for your mod, remember to make sure your tameable mob's class extends TameableAnimal.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Possible Future Additions/Roadmap</summary>\n\n\n- Pet Shops in villages and Animal Tamer villager\n- Improved Parrot AI\n- Additional Items for small animals like cages and perches\n- More enchantments\n- Improved mod compatibility\n\n</details>\n\n[Join our discussion on discord!](https://discord.gg/alexsmods)\n[Report bugs of this mod on

Configs should be migrated automatically, but please double-check whether any of your settings have been lost if updating from an older version!**\n\n## Features\n* Hide the crosshair when not looking at anything.\n* Hide or show it depending on what is being looked at.\n* Hide or show it depending on the currently equipped item.\n* Change the crosshair style for various situations.\n* Highly configurable.\n\n\n## Dependencies\nThis mod has been written for Minecraft >= 1.18.2.\n\n### Fabric version\n* requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n* from version 6 upwards, there is an optional dependency on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) for an ingame configuration screen\n* versions up to 5.5 require [ClothConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n* not required: [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for ingame configuration screen\n\n### (Neo)Forge version\n* from version 6 upwards, there is an optional dependency on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) for an ingame configuration screen\n* versions up to 5.5 require [ClothConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n\n## Mod Compatibility\nThis mod is very strongly coupled to vanilla Minecraft and has to hardcode a lot of interaction rules.\nThus, playing on a non-vanilla world will make the advanced features (context-dependent style) unreliable.\n\nIf you play with content mods, I recommend also installing [Dynamic Crosshair Compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshaircompat).\n\nIf you like dynamic UI elements, also check out my other mod [Auto HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/autohud) that extends dynamic behaviour to most of the HUD.\n\nDynamicCrosshair is currently not compatible with [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) (set its `enabledGui` setting to false to use its other features).","published":"2022-05-15T15:58:15.616504Z","updated":"2024-07-27T12:25:43.718825Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2376021,"followers":1088,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["20bC160n","zJdREVIO","IXij3556","GkGeCML8","Jx2bA8fW","wX0EkxBG","UIPy4N6Y","u6oZjWMI","fwgB6xzq","rbuG9j4d","42x8E1l2","I3ozSAMN","UsI5wvVJ","Ex7R0pvH","bevKbyCT","C9PPMB8n","PUz7ZA69","DnIkKSEu","pKw86PFV","L1X78OCz","piwY5EqP","KdZ4nnQf","KCnkG2JM","vOx5xdxw","8cW3fCjp","OojuYcAm","SoTS6lF5","JZoNSBuy","N8iKshJP","vOMoMaOE","dSEqWeht","6x22u0T1","N3ze65Pu","8npnkOAY","JCXboA43","GwfJ6OPL","Q5W9seuT","MDMciNGY","DOxF1Usr","kVzqYdl5","hBz2RX9S","mqjafYwh","4XF7aDYQ","PDcGuAk3","dB2WXccw","oE6ADLJm","kBkiCSXP","KdRiHgim","Ngbs1lmT","p8mFGtnA","aT7BTmm2","7pIz7Bqe","5Rbzl2ai","HQNnNcTz","rzl6699L","b1MI0lNn","XXp55Fwj","aDXQGAnW","7LySfCZd","jwMWMQBh","3Rj2xiej","UrGLoyuO","jdd7O6I5","3BXMBlz0","Bgo2WQoz","4yNSnLVO","1HKz8pDD","cdWvTN6A","zma0Z88N","EJvo2aYT","SnHjacoX","L3cqS0s1","XxwoXEjt","uuUU7D4O","oGBybcWG","ha2GrJES","qSS7rxZG","kEvLJuWh","nhu2REPZ","AVTfWKih","kgZyjYD0","25UaxOtl","Q7LLoEz8","m758kre1","VlilX4g3","NpJSZyut","KLOwuZTc","siGvzEkG","pnStFlrz","zT12VILM","cR2jSKNv","S5sH62fG","UwrH9Wmp","PYMFga4Y","5ABRCqrl","svCwRMnR","wlHubjbx","me9sUGWp","GaDrUzLS","H2k9LvrK","B8uyNMAs","dHnDtwk3","AF6KCHFM","hW7fVOwD","xMsvqe7U","rOBAdNim","kV3gDaO6","Afi523uo","n7vNnWWX","hUj6v5bw","4ZNImu1V","7POTmnEb","HEyECMZD","BfvDyEpZ","B3fvmlGz","N4UrisV7","d5kHzOKy","ONH6Kqie","YZEVRL4i","J6uJYksd","h3YFJv7Z","ggoGe2EL","d1DZkc4J","1A4txeh8","lJhn7D9r","PlUmODOj","OvVeBAYa","RqouYFCA","yl7hdLYl","SgFUFMUD","iKnz6GmD","8x7iVA0A","DLtLuMzW","Vk1E4s8i","P70fS7oo","I1X42LQO","GxY44U4X","vW2z45Qw","gTjxflCI","8TADH0x4","nqnapHoW","4Oy7MCbK","j6JI3Ye5","AKd5ifeI","yI2M7Yw8","plDJhPkU","TBUQvVSc","wrKCukUs","ob3ideD4","1Cz6IyIk","z2n9Rh5O","83ZByaiI","vNnu7BoP","9TBX0qkD","U4QPyiFl","MneD8ExX","rp8sdu78","eCPSnqOy","eRIHItNH","6W6aaYaB","qumfSFz3","UrOG4IKT","PhOrxa0w","c7j11R0M","5OHmUXr7","dpEeHhG0","f5ZXlx3Q","CPQFd6yO","8QA0JAbA","E7hrxyB5","AjOd8bzj","cUGjuUBN","tvgAGEoG","1endrUCg","pTukRirl","ok5RvpkL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZcR9weSm/8da8af58ca961f937bd05d41dcefa26be7b5c182.png"},"version":{"id":"U4QPyiFl","project_id":"ZcR9weSm","author_id":"bQuYYbeE","featured":false,"name":"[Forge

A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

Many mods utilize Bookshelf's code base to power their own mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Why use a library mod?</h3>\n<p>Library mods such as Bookshelf allow seemingly unrelated mods to share parts of the same code base. This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Minecraft. All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent. All of these creatures fulfill a necessary purpose, and either have unique drops, mechanics or functions, as there are no purely aesthetic creatures. That said, they also help make some environments in the game feel more alive. The models, textures, animations and AI are all stylistically compatible with the vanilla game's latest additions.\n\n\nThe new mobs currently added are as follows (fantastical mobs in blue, real-world ones in black, boss mobs in red):\n<details>\n<summary>New Mobs...</summary>\n\n#### In Release 1.0.0:\n- Grizzly Bear\n- Roadrunner\n- Bone Serpent\n- Gazelle\n- Crocodile\n- Fly\n- Hummingbird\n- Orca\n- Sunbird\n- Gorilla\n- Crimson Mosquito\n- Rattlesnake\n- Endergrade\n- Hammerhead Shark\n- Lobster\n- Komodo Dragon\n- Capuchin Monkey\n- Cave Centipede\n#### In Release 1.1.0:\n- Warped Toad\n- Moose\n#### In Release 1.2.0:\n- Mimicube\n- Raccoon\n- Blobfish\n#### In Release 1.3.0:\n- Seal\n- Cockroach\n- Shoebill\n#### In Release 1.4.0:\n- Elephant\n- Soul Vulture\n#### In Release 1.5.0:\n- Snow Leopard\n- Spectre\n- Crow\n#### In Release 1.6.0:\n- Alligator Snapping Turtle\n- Mungus\n- Mantis Shrimp\n#### In Release 1.7.0 (Mighty Monsters Update):\n- Guster\n- Warped Mosco\n- Straddler\n- Stradpole\n#### In Release 1.8.0 (Down Under Update):\n- Emu\n- Platypus\n- Dropbear\n- Tasmanian Devil\n- Kangaroo\n#### In Release 1.9.0 (Big and Small Update):\n- Cachalot Whale\n- Leafcutter Ant\n- Enderiophage\n#### In Release 1.10.0 (Ferocious Predators Update)\n- Bald Eagle\n- Tiger\n- Tarantula Hawk\n#### In Release 1.11.0\n- Void Worm\n- Frilled Shark\n- Mimic Octopus\n#### In Release 1.12.0\n- Seagull\n#### In Release 1.13.0 (Bygone Beasts Update)\n- Froststalker\n- Tusklin\n- Laviathan\n- Cosmaw\n#### In Release 1.14.0 (Come to Brazil Update)\n- Toucan\n- Maned Wolf\n- Anaconda\n- Anteater\n#### In Release 1.15.0 (Caves and Cliffs Update):\n- Rocky Roller\n- Flutter\n- Gelada Monkey\n#### In Release 1.16.0 (Atmospheric Update):\n- Jerboa\n- Terrapin\n- Comb Jelly\n- Cosmic Cod\n#### In Release 1.17.0 (Fan Favorites Update):\n- Bunfungus\n- Bison\n- Giant Squid\n#### In Release 1.18.0 (Fishy Business Update):\n- Devil's Hole Pupfish\n- Catfish\n- Flying Fish\n- Skelewag\n#### In Release 1.19.0 (Wilder Update):\n- Rain Frog\n- Potoo\n- Mudskipper\n- Rhinoceros\n- Sugar Glider\n#### In Release 1.20.0 (Very Scary Update):\n - Farseer\n - Skreecher\n - Underminer\n - Murmur\n#### In Release 1.21.0 (Forest Friends Update):\n - Skunk\n - Banana Slug\n - Blue Jay\n#### In Release 1.22.0 (Freshwater Update):\n - Caiman\n - Triops\n\n</details>\n\nMany of these mobs have unique drops or items associated with them. Following the traditional vanilla rules, rare or endangered animals do not have drops that can be obtained only through death. Rather, most of them, like the Komodo Dragon and Hammerhead Shark, drop their items when performing a specific function. Many of these drops and items can be used to craft unique weapons, arrows, potions, and armors with special effects. In addition, most of the mobs added are not outright hostile, but can be provoked by distance or attacking, like vanilla polar bears and piglins are. However, most of the unique, fantastical mobs are hostile.\n\nWhen joining a world with Alex's Mobs for the first time, the player will be given the **Animal Dictionary**. This is a very basic guide and documentation of each creature added by the mod, and should provide insight into uses for each of the mobs or their drops.\n\n\n If lost somehow, this book can be recrafted with a vanilla book, a green dye and any item from the mod.\n\n![Animal Dictionary](https://i.imgur.com/TEtIfTB.png)\n![Animal Dictionary 2](https://i.imgur.com/tt0ew4K.png)\n\nAlex's Mobs is intended to be used alongside other mods, including those that add new blocks, mobs, biomes and dimensions. It is **extremely configurable**, and all mob spawns can be specified by BiomeDictionary, biome registry names, dimension tags, and biome categories. This mod should play nice with biome adding mods, and should be a perfect fit for many modpacks, whether they be Vanilla-themed or extremely advanced.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\n- Nebula240 and StickZilla (Spanish Translations)\n- Mikeliro (PT-BR Translations)\n- ChirenCQR (Chinese Translations)\n- Robongio (Swedish Translations)\n- Elloellie (German Translations)\n- BardinTheDwarf (Russian Translations)\n- Othuntgithub (Korean Translations)\n\nThank you for translating our mod!

href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invmovecompats\">CurseForge</a> (Mirror)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThis is a rewrite of the previously separate Forge and Fabric versions.<br>\nMod compatibilities have been moved into an addon mod: [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\n\n![demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/media/demo.gif)\n\nEnables moving, jumping, sprinting, etc. from within inventories.\n\nAlso hides the darkened background tint in inventories that don't pause the game.\n\nBoth features can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config menu.\n\nThis mod is client-side, but it may raise alarms if used on servers with anticheat.<br>\nI take no responsibility if you get banned or something because you used this on public servers.\n\n### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)\n\nRequires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) on Forge/Fabric/Quilt.<br>\nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) on Fabric.<br>\nRequires [Quilted Fabric API / Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) on Quilt.<br>\nFor Fabric, you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to be able to open the config screen.<br>\nFor Forge, I also recommend [Game Menu Mod Option](https://modrinth.com/mod/gamemenumodoption) so you can change settings in-game.\n\n## Config (In-game)\n\n#### General:\n- Enable Mod: Enable the entire mod\n- Debug Display: Enables a debug overlay that can help debug compatibility problems.\n\n#### UI Movement:\n- Move In Inventories: Enable movement in inventories<br>\n  There is a keybind you can set to toggle this setting (unbound by default)\n- Allow Jumping: Allow jumping in inventories\n- Sneak Mode: How to handle sneaking in inventories:\n  - Off = No sneaking\n  - Maintain = Keep sneaking if you were when the inventory opened (default)\n  - Pressed = Sneak only while holding the sneak button (can be distracting when shift-clicking)\n- Allow Dismounting: Allow dismounting from mounts in inventories (overrides \"Sneak Mode\" while on a mount)\n- Text Field Disables Movement: Disable movement when a text field is focused (like search bars or in an anvil)\n\n#### UI Background:\n- Hide Inventory Backgrounds: Hides the background tint while in inventories.\n- Pause Screens Background: How to handle screens that pause the game:\n  - Show = Always show background\n  - ShowSP = Show background in singleplayer, otherwise allow hide\n  - AllowHide = Allow background to be hidden\n\nThe Movement and Background pages also have expandable categories containing toggles for individual inventory types.<br>\nThe base mod only has a category for vanilla inventories. For more mod compatibilities, see [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\nAny screens not handled by installed mod compatibilities are added to the \"Unrecognized UI Types\" section, grouped by modid.\n\n## Usage\n\nFeel free to use in packs if you wish.\n\nThe only official downloads are from the InvMove GitHub, Modrinth, or CurseForge page.<br>\nBe careful downloading them from elsewhere, as unauthorized reposts are not monitored and could contain malware.<br>\n(If you are interested in the mod being added to another platform, please open an issue!)\n\nThe mod is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/blob/master/COPYING)","published":"2022-02-20T20:50:17.872579Z","updated":"2024-08-03T18:45:41.733187Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1607996,"followers":1244,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g6dHjPlj","Nw08AijY","zSjRFisS","KlCCrdyH","z1wUcYrz","Rowb4urF","FxtmKzFE","nyLttvyA","2PM0Ne3I","mXm80CHn","nc2YXBFR","ZUUyXFpC","KZODMPL5","YglVnx4G","AvfVeby1","aarEmm3o","VgnPhVTW","Clo0PUhb","FlJXgCDA","ODrlrF3Z","whx4cyXm","DjMssqvc","FJ91FXja","O575lNuT","dGo1L388","2tK5XdF0","um5St4s3","u2qv60JQ","sVkuPH9Y","qTu058ya","gn5FSncy","sWRkeaiE","LG7n0kA8","RKDVymOM","UTuW1mu8","RsLNtqpA","H2moqgPv","kzI0tILB","2sYsuomN","1uJ8OF0p","Q59zS7Fb","NudOSeIR","L9gZxJNb","VE4bOg3y","WzbaGwer","pfLgaUxC","hrMnbArx","920571eR","h6ELnOF4","JxGn75dh","vk2Y8XQV","WIXovitR","AE0sDDm3","W5h8ZaUy","kqq0UN1u","6CNOChud","1BZ0wHLG","LGhnGid6","VSooa0oK","qlq09IgJ","iiUJSWK2","rppVtrEO","ZGPw3w38","FcdIvKru","ciO3M5kB","Z2eGw8Et"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/7c10ef4460c5b2998dac53a494ec9051851f0e76.png"},"version":{"id":"6CNOChud","project_id":"REfW2AEX","author_id":"U9xrZlQH","featured":false,"name":"v0.8.4 (1.20.0/1)","version_number":"1.20-0.8.4-forge","changelog":"(note: marked as alpha because I did not have time to test every version/loader)\n<br>- Update for 1.20\n<br>- Workaround for issues with certain freecam mods ([gh-19](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/issues/19))","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-18T23:58:21.898641Z","downloads":133581,"version_type":"alpha","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f7d7a683c2e4899d013c207c1f11bee7f1f3354e47345972d9e3f60dcab411255755720520496c72ef79469ed2e07cf61a2890f686b70e055119fd4b119608e7","sha1":"5a68c14eca94747c78b4492c781612d17b450c05"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/REfW2AEX/versions/6CNOChud/InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","filename":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":125604,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"JoLgnJ0G","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"1rXrl5vy","user":{"id":"U9xrZlQH","username":"PieKing1215","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13819558?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-05-27T06:09:15.544829Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"InvMove-1.20-0.8.4-Forge.jar"},"mods\\SneakyCurses-v8.0.2-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"559e49325a535e6f799e029ae62c3ab586b61ada44e0cfaa24c5e487dc6eed56d3246da5c3bc24b52356c860d316094747a13b61108119df594fc1961de3fa5c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"TivKCwTx","slug":"sneaky-curses","project_type":"mod","team":"ntEVwuas","title":"Sneaky Curses","description":"Obfuscates curses so you no longer know what to expect!

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

[Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras).\n\n## 📖 About\n\n**Sinytra Connector** is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mods\non [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net). Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving\ndevelopers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once, as well as allowing players to play\nall their favourite mods in one modpack.\n\nAlso check out [Forgified Fabric API](https://github.com/Sinytra/ForgifiedFabricAPI), a port of Fabric API to NeoForge.  \nTo learn more about how Connector works, you can read our [Introductory blog post](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/11).\n\n## 📋 Usage Guide\n\nTo install Connector and its dependencies, follow the same installation steps as you would for any other mods:\n1. If you haven't already, install NeoForge. We recommend using the latest stable version.\n2. Download the latest release of Connector and drop the jar in your mods folder.\n3. Following that, you'll want to download the [**Forgified Fabric API**](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api). It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it. We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager), but if you have the option to do so, don't install it.\n4. Now that you have all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and **just drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.\n\n## 🔍 Get help\n\nIf you're having trouble running a mod on Connector, open our [Mod Compatibility Thread](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions) and check if it lists your mod as incompatible. If it's not listed, please open a new issue in Connector's repository on GitHub.\n\nHere's a few tips to follow when reporting issues:\n1. Make sure you are using latest available version. Look for existing issues that might've already been answered / fixed. Think about whether the issue is caused by Connector itself and not another mod you've installed. To test this, try reproducing the same issue on Fabric.\n2. Navigate to [the issues tab](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues) and open a [new issue](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues/new/choose). Select one of the available templates depending on the topic. Fill in the required fields. In order to increase our chances of identifying and reproducing the issue, please make sure to include as many details as possible.\n3. Once you're done describing the problem, submit the issue. We'll get to you as soon as we can.\n\nPlease note that providing as many details as possible is crucial to help us find and resolve the issue faster, while also getting you a fixed version ASAP.\n\n## ⚖️ License\n\nSinytra Connector is, and will always remain, licensed under the MIT license.

Once open, you can select what mode you want to use, undo, redo, select your position, and more.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_gui.png\" alt=\"Building Tool GUI\">\n\n### GUI\n\nThe GUI contains various buttons to modify the Building Tool's settings, as well as some convienent tools.\n\n- Pressing, `enter`, `e`, `escape`, or clicking anywhere on the screen that isn't a button will close the GUI.\n- Hovering over any item on the GUI will display a tooltip on the right side to explain what it does and how to use it.\n- Using the radial menu, you can select which mode you want to use.\n- Some modes support positions. If they do, a button will appear on the top left to select a position based on your current location. This is mainly useful when right clicking a block isn't possible or is highly inconvenient.\n- The Undo and Redo buttons on the left exist to do exactly what they say. They attempt to undo or redo the last action you performed with the Building Tool. Up to 32 actions are saved and can be undone.\n- Some modes have additional settings, these settings will appear below the undo and redo buttons.\n- The button in the middle is used to select what block you want to use. When you click it, a text box will open for you to type a block state. This can be done in game as well, but some blocks like water are more than difficult to click on.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Middle Click: Selects the current block state you're looking at (also can be done in the GUI).\n- Left Click: This is the general key for \"do the thing\" depending on what mode you're in.\n- Right Click Air: Opens the GUI.\n- Right Click Block: Some modes use this to set positions, but ones that don't also allow this to \"do the thing\" as well.\n- Shift + Right Click: Clears the currently selected positions.\n\n### Modes\n\nBuilding Tool Modes are different operations that the Building Tool can perform.\n\n- Extend: Detects a pattern based on the side of the block you click, and attempts to place blocks in front of that to continue that pattern. If you're familiar with the old Builder's Wands mod, it's essentially the same idea.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_extend.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Extend\">\n\n- Flood: Fills all air blocks within the y level slice that you click, until it hits a border, then continues to fill going downward. This is useful for filling a lake with water for example.\n- Fill: Very similar to the vanilla fill command. Select two corners and then left click to fill the area between with the currently selected block. Has options for replacing specific blocks and only placing a frame or hollow box.\n- Line: Places a line of blocks between the selected positions using the currently selected block.\n- Clone: Copies the selected region and pastes it where you click. Allows for rotating, mirroring, and cutting instead of copying.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_clone.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Clone\">\n\n- Move: Moves the selected region in the direction that you punch.\n- Clear: Removes all blocks within the selected positions.\n- Shape: Places a shape where you click. The shape and what blocks will be replaced can be changed though the mode's properties in the GUI.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_shape.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Shape\">\n\n### Mode Properties\n\nSome modes support additional settings to modify their behavior. Some examples include:\n\n- Integrity: Determines how many blocks will actually place.\n- Replace: Determines what the mode will replace when placing blocks. All replaces everything, Air replaces only air, and Clicked replaces the block you clicked on.\n- Rotation and Mirror: Rotates or mirrors the cloned region. Allows for selecting a random value as well.\n\n## 🍡 Structure Gel Block\n\nThis block is a creative tool to fill the insides of structures easily. The gel is replaced with air when your structure generates while all air is ignored when being placed. This ensures that your structures won't have natural terrain where it shouldn't be. The gel block behaves similarly to structure voids in that you can walk through it, while actually being visible.\n\nWhen placing gel while sneaking, you can trigger the spreading mechanic. Each gel spreads differently, and you can read how they work by hovering over the item.\n\n## 🍮 Meet the Gels!\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Red Gel</summary>\n\n### Red Gel\n\nRed gel uses the default spreading mechanic, spreading along the cardinal directions, only replacing air.\n\n![Red Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/503c7a3dae8e758a1db3fa55e64d75f856576784.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Blue Gel\n\nBlue gel functions similarly to red, except it won't spread into locations where the sky can be seen.\n\n![Blue Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/e21b268d8e6aab180443d805f5041f1993fedbd0.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Green Gel\n\nGreen gel spreads the same as red gel, with the addition of also spreading diagonally. This allows it to get through corners created by vines or other complex builds. Be careful not to let it leak outside of your build.\n\n![Green Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/361a39fc615627ccdde9dbccd4f5b1ff491bb7cc.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cyan Gel</summary>\n\n### Cyan Gel\n\nCyan gel acts as a combination of green and blue gel, by both spreading diagonally and avoiding the sky.\n\n![Cyan Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0d18b88d9a6441352e39341ebe7a69cb7e221bf3.gif)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Orange Gel</summary>\n\n### Orange Gel\n\nOrange gel behaves the same as red gel, but the distance it spreads is determined by how many you're holding when you place it, making it handy for builds in open areas.\n\n![Orange Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0eb11f35e96d7f27f8ccf58fa1bfecb2bd5733f8.gif)<br>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Yellow Gel</summary>\n\n### Yellow Gel\n\nYellow gel will only spread along the plane that you're facing when you place it, making it great for sealing off walls, windows, or other holes that the gel would otherwise go through.\n\n![Yellow Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/f8e014711ee125fadf49da2f3154ee95541ff1e8.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Removing Gels</summary>\n\n## Removing Gels\n\nGel can be removed by using gunpowder on it. Doing this will trigger a chain reaction, removing all connected gels of the same type.\n\n![Removing Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/06352441f7bd8e0fc14d3bd8af3f5c5449aefe30.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Examples</summary>\n\n## Examples\n\nHere's an example of how it could be used in a build. If this structure were loaded into the game, the gel inside would be replaced with air, while the air outside would not be placed.\n\n![house_example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/d825a427e103a45857cc527bd3027f3736bc2eb1.gif)<br>\n\nThe code for this block is designed in a way such that you can easily extend it and hook into its behavior with methods in blocks.IStructureGel, should you need behavior not already implemented.\n\nThis is a core mod that modifies a few internal classes. If you get a crash with this mod that only occurs when mixed with another mod, this may be the cause. Please test before reporting.\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2023-05-21T23:11:08.916649Z","updated":"2024-06-21T05:36:14.723962Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":439943,"followers":50,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rrIuQG5f","YtlOh5ib","n7xrHFAI","hoSPdpVk","sC5VyD3U","Yj94wn7H","bsBVjIWk","bgOjiT8y","pCNl93Ka","DjvKx9sL","p2hBgWM7","Wcqj3c1P","czn0eUba","CrRybArg","WdmDpRR4","FQtCiGpd","l0hKtmBk","xavY0MZc","z95TPh9D","tdOzdRbb","RJ3sF1SB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/80dbc0d2d3acadcfcfc1bfa79488f0d353bac1ea.png"},"version":{"id":"xavY0MZc","project_id":"T8TGycIQ","author_id":"QlRPeSYG","featured":false,"name":"Structure Gel API v2.16.2","version_number":"2.16.2","changelog":"Added `/structure_gel getfeatures` command.

(Zombies can only jump one block for\n  example).\n\n## Limitations\nThe ai does not do additional pathfinding, so it can't calculate a complicated series of jumps. Also, the ai starts to fail under very fast mob speeds or high jumps.\n\n## Configuration\nThe config file uses JSON. Add a mob by listing its id, and a priority. You can find mob ids by using the /summon command - the list of arguments will be a list of mob ids. The priority is a bit jenky. It represents what priority the AI has over other AIs. A lower value means that the jumping AI probably won't be overridden, but it might override other AI's. Unfortunately, the most certain way to gauge this is to look at the entity source code, but setting a low priority should in most cases be totally fine.\n\n## Installation\nThis is a regular [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install) mod, except that [Fabric Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin) is required.  \nDependencies that need to be in the mod folder:\n\n-   [Fabric Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)\n-   [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)\n","published":"2021-01-26T02:52:18.859577Z","updated":"2023-12-21T20:01:25.562781Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":98282,"followers":118,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["bEMaiOTx","E7hsRLGO","ws9rTWHC","dw4g51oB","40sT1JPD","5hm10noi","6CxMFXxG","ddGsksMj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Lh7ROUhC/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ddGsksMj","project_id":"Lh7ROUhC","author_id":"4mbpRYUJ","featured":false,"name":"Mobs Attempt Parkour 0.5.2-1.20","version_number":"0.5.2-1.20","changelog":"Fix crash with loader 0.15.0","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-21T20:01:26.482371Z","downloads":93739,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5639ac66889c79ae8b558c93d9db8661e9611a09","sha512":"beb622dfdaeb66584a2c91f70cd6eba8798f9ef4beefefa5dbe4a60118dff0154550d0cf4b25727755c646a5a5b7dd26645c08216c48e6deb615084f6ce5c8ce"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Lh7ROUhC/versions/ddGsksMj/mobs-attempt-parkour-0.5.2-1.20.jar","filename":"mobs-attempt-parkour-0.5.2-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":156525,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"YP1Wty8C","user":{"id":"4mbpRYUJ","username":"Barribob","name":"Michael Yoshimura","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/32251924?v=4","bio":"","created":"2020-11-06T00:22:37.692642Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"mobs-attempt-parkour-0.5.2-1.20.jar"},"mods\\Tips-Forge-1.20.1-12.1.8.jar":{"sha512":"73930800913520170fe20cc4cb7b30e175ab19e8457e572f20ddfd47082a5a7fa12e7072f278b3ed4191a59efc979f65a9c9592be1287eba3faa65ed35b2cc4b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AMCbgyVw","slug":"tips","project_type":"mod","team":"SEOvZNdW","title":"Tips","description":"This mod adds tips to loading menus.

[BisectHosting](https://bisecthosting.com/spark).​\n\nBisectHosting are Minecraft server hosting experts, ready to help you create and host your very own server!

There is a special 25% off discount available for spark users - click the link above to create your server today.\n\n## What does spark do?\n\nspark is made up of three separate components:\n\n* **CPU Profiler**: Diagnose performance issues.\n* **Memory Inspection**: Diagnose memory issues.\n* **Server Health Reporting**: Keep track of overall server health.\n\n### ⚡ CPU Profiler\n\nspark's profiler can be used to diagnose performance issues: \"lag\", low tick rate, high CPU usage, etc.\n\nIt is:\n\n* **Lightweight** - can be ran in production with minimal impact.\n* **Easy to use** - no configuration or setup necessary, just install the plugin.\n* **Quick to produce results** - running for just ~30 seconds is enough to produce useful insights into problematic areas for performance.\n* **Customisable** - can be tuned to target specific threads, sample at a specific interval, record only \"laggy\" periods, etc\n* **Highly readable** - simple tree structure lends itself to easy analysis and interpretation. The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2024-08-12T18:54:49.346864Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1874411,"followers":955,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF","iKVUNCME","i3FZxFQO","h0hKeaRD","85t1ZpLC","vl2NraaO","TsIZU7vG","KYGTUMOq","iYliEQKf","pxV5WOiQ","qTSaozEL","mHuABI9W"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"4FXHDE9F","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":false,"name":"1.10.53 (Forge 1.20.1)","version_number":"1.10.53-forge","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.1 to Modrinth.

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you.

Configure the options, keybinds and server list as you would like them to be shipped in the modpack\n2. Join any world and run \"/defaultoptions saveAll\" to save your current options in the defaultoptions folder (located in the config folder where it should remain)\n3. Do not include the options.txt and servers.dat from the root directory in your modpack\n4. Fresh installations (meaning no existing options.txt) will now start out with your default options\n\n**If you are using FoamFix Anarchy Version**, disable `B:initOptions` in the FoamFix config or else Default Options will not work.

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nJust Enough Effect Descriptions (JEED) is a JEI plugin that provides useful information regarding status effects.\n\nThe mod adds a new Effects recipe category accessed either by clicking any of the newly added status effect icons on the JEI item screen or by clicking an active effect from its box on the inventory screen.\n\nHere you'll be able to view information regarding such status effect such as items that can provide it or its description as well as which mod it's from or its effect color.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8qv5ZN.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UfGgoGG.png)\n\n<center>\n\n## 🧪 Customization 🧪\n</center>\n\nThe mod automatically adds all registered status effect to its page, however modded effects won't had a description.\n\nModders can easily add such descriptions to their effect by adding the string `\"effect.[mod_id].[effect_name].description\"` to their language file.\n\nSince the mod can only automatically detect food items as effect providing ones, mod developers can also easily add support to their custom effect or effect providing items by adding some recipes into their mod.\n\nTo do so one can simply use one of the two newly added recipes categories:\n- \"jeed:effect_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can provide an effect in the following format:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:effect_provider\",\n  \"effect\":{\n    \"id\": \"minecraft:haste\"\n  },\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:beacon\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- \"jeed:potion_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can contain any registered potion like tipped arrows for example:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:potion_provider\",\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:splash_potion\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:tipped_arrow\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you would like to help me provide build in description support for many modded effect be sure to contact me on my discord!\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so

mod adds fade-in animation for chunks, like in Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. And, if you want to, animations like in [ChunkAnimator] or similar mods.\nNo more chunks appearing right in front of you out of nowhere! Unlike other mods for [Fabric], it works perfectly fine with [Sodium] and [Iris]! \n\n## Supported Minecraft versions\n- 1.18.x\n- 1.19.x\n- 1.20.x\n- 1.21.x\n\n## Dependencies\n- [Sodium] 0.4.x - 1.20.x versions\n- [Sodium] 0.5+ - 1.20.1+ versions\n\n# Compatibility with Forge\nIn order for the mod to work with Forge Mod Loader, you need to complete the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Install [Sinytra Connector]:\n- Install it from the official page by clicking the link above.\n\n### Step 2: Install [Embeddium]:\n- Install it from the official page by clicking the link above.\n\n### Step 3: Configure version overrides:\n- Navigate to the `config` folder inside **your Minecraft installation folder** (usually `.minecraft`). If there's no `config` folder, create one.\n- Open `fabric_loader_dependencies.json` inside `config` folder. If there's no `fabric_loader_dependencies.json` file, create one.\n- Paste the following text inside:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"chunksfadein\": {\n      \"+depends\": {\n        \"embeddium\": \">0.2.18+mc1.20.1\"\n      },\n      \"-depends\": {\n        \"sodium\": \"IGNORED\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n- Save the file and restart/launch the game.\n- Done!\n\n# Features\n## Showcase\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CanA5ADOis0\">\n</iframe>\n\n## Flexible config with Mod Menu support!\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kerudion/chunksfadein/blob/main/readme-assets/config.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">","published":"2022-12-04T17:38:44.944066Z","updated":"2024-07-07T17:54:44.501135Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":426075,"followers":1005,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration","game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["hEplZtg0","KJNlvXs4","JUS3uOQj","mwZ79PNk","CNlaXfoU","zal4toW9","V07HmAQL","CYYu4Jdv","4dvYdTtV","UzboZpag","xOscM10S","i5fPLkvN","MxfDZffU","dSrsmT8V","d96KPSMT","n5Px2K9p","xYqeXu1V","IlFmvKEE","sf57ybJ5","qTAQmsC2","UBGBOzFy","VMGkV4GJ","Ic6wAVB0","JbGM3yfS","zjkLzsMF","iFcLLQFI","L5P3GlJd","Dm49FIFV","xoi9FwQ1","U9LXbQiq","iCsaIPkc","NRcn8zRv","4A9JTT7P","1MVqFeuW","ELVmwkr2","fNIKQ1iq","iFdj0jQT","V4Xydbrm","PGqpUEhW","aItOAKVN","EvgXpevG","ZGLPcJEK","iHTbrdPv","15vyEm1W","DLsWr0Om","l93ndBxU","WllUavRq","6eaReL7j","ksY4JosB","TmMsFGWm","uEHUQ9tW","GzCXUfbp","93ILsQAj","3R6zUuhL","FHldinWI","gr61TaqK","XddlRahr","MjAt9FVE","vySrSZST","PGlH4K9i","vKsmwuM6","eiJDsAQk","16SoZEWM","QrVXrdT3","INLnTyVe","iLVykV1K","PEetbdug"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JaNmzvA8/e9b2e86179280fc209c0cbc5de36b5946fc7cb50.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"iLVykV1K","project_id":"JaNmzvA8","author_id":"4UUDD3CQ","featured":false,"name":"v1.0.7-1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.7-1.20.1","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with SkinShuffle (thanks IMB11)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-07T17:25:59.414936Z","downloads":12576,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"70a00fd7a267a1cc1eb3e8a58d8c3e2865f07a8beb46d53ec19706a7454b04525d044ac4a9f49b16880df56fed603ea35792e99e5289809acbe6c65ee4dc212a","sha1":"e3203e9f11ac2b2341bf2e8e0e02f83c63a21911"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JaNmzvA8/versions/iLVykV1K/chunksfadein-1.0.7-1.20.1.jar","filename":"chunksfadein-1.0.7-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":313164,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"b8eaec27c896f06474562ce3291a5ead0a70df53","sha512":"ce9721df836eda965babcbf9b801894128fff9aaf33c745c181db817b45b22288ccb8d6d762775a019169dc27459da83db5c3fa928cccaa69d76091dd541ec22"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JaNmzvA8/versions/iLVykV1K/chunksfadein-1.0.7-1.20.1-sources.jar","filename":"chunksfadein-1.0.7-1.20.1-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":182886,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"YL57xq9U","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"xNqnrvWG","user":{"id":"4UUDD3CQ","username":"kerudion","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/4UUDD3CQ/47f366ca6f1e653cd6c40b56de25e172d2cafbca.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-04T17:38:12.735210Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"chunksfadein-1.0.7-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\frame_changer-1.20.1-2.0.0.jar":{"sha512":"f7361cffab539e340124b3f6c47062299d1e8e1726e907295a69cb0d68b2cf1cec4b27340cdc459a23da27b988ed76c9b7eeafd5c9ccebc6fda1bfc909be7ed9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"597XsRkb","slug":"frame-changer","project_type":"mod","team":"eLhxf6QO","title":"Frame Changer","description":"Adds customizable Nether portal frames and stylish obsidian decor.","body":"## Overview\n\n*Obby obby obby! (Oi oi oi!)*\n\nThis mod adds some lovely obsidian building block decor, courtesy of Finneganso.\n\nTo facilitate building portals out of such blocks, players can also customize what blocks can be used in Nether portals, using the block tag `frame_changer:portal_frames`. A few other tweaks and extensibilities are added in the config for modpack developers.\n\n## Config\n\nThere are a few different categories of changes, detailed below:\n### Custom Portal Frames\n- Portal frames can be made of anything in the tag `frame_changer:portal_frames` (default: **true**)\n\n### Custom Exit Portals\n\n- When entering a new portal, the portal on the other side is made out of a custom block (default: **false**)\n- The block ID of the custom exit portal frame. (default: **`\"minecraft:obsidian\"`**)\n  - **Note:** the formatting is key! The string should look like \"`modID:blockID\"`. Valid examples include `\"minecraft:enchanting_table\"`, `\"architects_palette:moonshale\"`, etc.\n  - You can also set the blockID to be something that isn't in `portal_frames`. The exit portal would still form on the other side, but if it's broken for any reason it will not naturally reignite.\n\n### Portal Break Changes\n\n- Does breaking a portal have a chance of making obsidian-based blocks in its frame turn into crying variants? (default: **false**)\n  - If Spelunkery is installed, and their config's `\"portal_destruction_crying_obsidian\"` is set to **true**, then the behavior for obsidian decor from this mod will still be enabled.\n- The chance that obsidian blocks are converted into their crying variants if a portal is broken (default: **0.33**)\n\n### Tags (datapack required)\n- As mentioned, the block tag `frame_changer:portal_frames` contains the blocks that can make up valid Nether portals. By default, this just includes obsidian and derivative decor included in this mod.\n\n---\n\n**Requires [Blueprint](https://modrinth.com/mod/blueprint).** Optionally compatible with [Spelunkery](https://modrinth.com/mod/spelunkery) if [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) is installed.*\n\n*Despite my best efforts, hammer and chisel items will *not* turn any obsidian bricks into chiseled obsidian. The portal fluid recipes are all in there, however!\n\nFeel free to direct any suggestions and bugs to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/davidjjung/framechanger/issues)! This might not work with some other portal-tweaking mods, so let me know of any potential incompatibilities.\n\nAgain, thanks to Finneganso for offering his block textures!","published":"2024-02-08T17:10:15.994526Z","updated":"2024-03-15T18:37:45.899292Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":852,"followers":22,"categories":["cursed","decoration","game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["s8XSOB8o","3Ntit21K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/597XsRkb/d0b1d1339ff1f58fb64f78da28b807cbce4f1a2d.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"3Ntit21K","project_id":"597XsRkb","author_id":"O0qroui1","featured":false,"name":"Frame Changer 2.0.0","version_number":"2.0.0","changelog":"1.20.1 port.

In vanilla, these faces are rendered for every single block that the painting is made of.\nThis is a waste of resources, as the faces are never visible. This mod fixes that by not rendering these faces.\n\nThis may seem like a small optimization, but these tiny faces are equivalent to the full block face, so:\n\n- Front - 4 vertices\n- Back - 4 vertices\n- ~~Top - 4 vertices~~\n- ~~Bottom - 4 vertices~~\n- ~~Left - 4 vertices~~\n- ~~Right - 4 vertices~~\n\nMakes a total of 24 vertices per block on vanilla.

extends SwordItem> createSword(String name, Supplier<? extends SwordItem> tTypedSupplier) {\n        return SwordExtension.super.createSword(name, this, tTypedSupplier);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo what about creating our object using this Facade class:\n```\npublic class ModItems {\n    public static final DeferredRegister<Item> ITEMS = DeferredRegister.create(Registries.ITEM, \"MOD_ID\");\n    public static final ModItemFactoryFacade ITEM_FACTORY = new ModItemFactoryFacade();\n\n    public static final RegistryObject<Item> MY_ITEM_1 = ITEM_FACTORY.create(\"my_item_1\");\n    public static final RegistryObject<Item> MY_ITEM_2 = ITEM_FACTORY.create(\"my_item_2\", new Item.Properties());\n    public static final RegistryObject<Item> MY_ITEM_3 = ITEM_FACTORY.create(\"my_item_3\", () -> new Item(new Item.Properties()));\n\n    //First example of creating Facade object from up\n    public static final RegistryObject<SwordItem> MY_SWORD_1 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_1\", ITEM_FACTORY, Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F);\n    public static final RegistryObject<? extends SwordItem> MY_SWORD_2 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_2\", ITEM_FACTORY, () -> new SwordItem(Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F, new Item.Properties()));\n\n\n    //Second example of creating Facade object from up\n    public static final RegistryObject<SwordItem> MY_SWORD_3 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_3\", Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F);\n    public static final RegistryObject<? extends SwordItem> MY_SWORD_4 = ITEM_FACTORY.createSword(\"my_sword_4\", () -> new SwordItem(Tiers.STONE, 3, -2.4F, new Item.Properties()));\n}\n```\nNow lets's look on args... array. It is an array of arguments for creating an object (Will be changed in future for better readability).\n\nCurrently available Factories and extensions: \n```\nItemFactory (ArrowExtension, BowExtension, BowlExtension, MusicDiscExtension, SmithingTemplateExtension, SwordExtension, AxeExtension, PickaxeExtension, ShovelExtension, HoeExtension)\nBlockFactory (BushExtension, FlowerExtension, PottedFlowerExtension)\nParticleFactory\nEffectFactory\nPaintingFactory\nPotionFactory\nSoundEventFactory\nCreativeTabFactory\nEntityFactory\nTag Utils\nTag utils focus on tag creating and making using tags easier.\n```\nFor example if you want to create item tag you need to use ItemTagFactory:\n```\npublic class MyItemTags {\n    public static final TagFactory<Item> TAG_FACTORY = new ItemTagFactory(\"MY_MOD_ID\");\n\n    public static final TagKey<Item> MY_TAG = TAG_FACTORY.createTag(\"my_tag\");\n}\nCreative Tab Utils\nCreative tab utils are used to add items to Creative Tab that you need.\n```\nFirstly we need to go to our class that subscribed for mod events and add this function (inner part of method is just example): \n```\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void addCreativeTabs(BuildCreativeModeTabContentsEvent event) {\n    new SimpleTabAdder(event)\n            .addAllToTab(CreativeModeTabs.INGREDIENTS, ModItems.MY_ITEM_1, ModItems.MY_ITEM_2, ModItems.MY_ITEM_3)\n            .addAllToTab(CreativeModeTabs.COMBAT, ModItems.MY_SWORD_1, ModItems.MY_SWORD_2, ModItems.MY_SWORD_3);\n}\n```\nTrading with Villagers and Wanderers Utils\nTemporalAPI makes trading a lot easier. Here is an example of it:\n```\npublic static final TradeCustomizer tradeCustomizer = new SimpleTradeCustomizer();\n\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void customizeTradesWithVillagers(VillagerTradesEvent event) {\n    tradeCustomizer.customize(event, new VillagerTrade(\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.ANDESITE, 2),\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.EMERALD, 3),\n            new VillagerTradeDescription(\n                    VillagerProfession.ARMORER, 1, 5, 5, 0.5f\n            )\n    ));\n}\n\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void customizeTradesWithWanderers(WandererTradesEvent event) {\n    tradeCustomizer.customize(event, new WandererTrade(\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.ANDESITE, 2),\n            new TradingItemHolder(Items.EMERALD, 3),\n            new WandererTradeDescription(\n                    WandererTradeDescription.TradeRarity.RARE, 5, 5, 0.5f\n            )\n    ));\n}\n```\nWorld Features Utils\nWill be expanded in the next updates.\n\nItem Properties Utils\nAdding needed properties to bows, shields, etc.\n```\n@SubscribeEvent\npublic void clientSetup(final FMLClientSetupEvent event) {\n    event.enqueueWork(() -> {\n        TemporalItemProperties.makeBow(ModItems.MY_BOW_1);\n        TemporalItemProperties.makeShield(ModItems.MY_SHIELD_1);\n        TemporalItemProperties.makeCrossbow(ModItems.MY_CROSSBOW_1);\n        TemporalItemProperties.putCompostable(ModBlocks.MY_FLOWER_1, 4);\n    });\n}\n ```\nFAQ:\n \nWill This Mod Be Getting A Fabric Version:\nNo a fabric version is not planned\n \nCan I use this mod in my Modpacks:\nYes, feel free to use this mod in any modpack!\n\nHow Do I suggest features or report Bugs:\nJoin our discord above for any comments, questions, suggestions, or problems!","published":"2024-02-15T21:54:30.378738Z","updated":"2024-06-30T13:20:58.662137Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":43244,"followers":4,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["G1Yppdfn","W6zu1DJy","t9Zhao2s","WT6tW8nQ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JDtt43My/ca58bad27340df2e980bc84786a1ab5df21191c9.png"},"version":{"id":"WT6tW8nQ","project_id":"JDtt43My","author_id":"mSiGS0Lf","featured":false,"name":"Temporal API 1.6.6","version_number":"1.6.6","changelog":"- Fixed many game breaking bugs","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-30T13:20:59.197266Z","downloads":1643,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4f60dd736d80de41c5e4f2383cbeb841877b5886","sha512":"405782317546b4443051dedcc87ca0d0c57c80ac15f4557da865048d0e717c68daa7bdbf966fd240282a8ea4c7a1b5ecafc7a635f153b91956aff2a064ead144"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JDtt43My/versions/WT6tW8nQ/temporalapi-1.6.6.jar","filename":"temporalapi-1.6.6.jar","primary":true,"size":195194,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Ob3vLyNs","user":{"id":"mSiGS0Lf","username":"Cyber_Rat","name":"Thorny Ron","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/mSiGS0Lf/ca58bad27340df2e980bc84786a1ab5df21191c9.png","bio":null,"created":"2024-02-05T19:24:05.533195Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"temporalapi-1.6.6.jar"},"mods\\trolldom-1.20.1-2.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"b270e24c994bba856eadcfa44ab982823652bc453c71349078e995dba759d40b4e3ee7686b5f74d97301d8b520258b195e9aa087d26fa56ae8e207266f96728b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gu9PQOOc","slug":"trolldom","project_type":"mod","team":"ICBrGhpj","title":"trolldom","description":"Adds four elemental shrines that generates in the world, performing certain tasks at the shrines grants elemental boons which lasts until death.","body":"## Introduction\nAdds four elemental shrines that generates in the world, performing certain tasks at the shrines grants elemental boons which lasts until death.\n\n![Hero image showing all elemental shrines](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu9PQOOc/images/c0f1e97a3e32f4a224c0a851b73a5b8720be2334.png)\n\n## Shrines & Boons\nYou can check the advancements for information on where to find the shrines and how to gain the boons, once you've gained a boon you can open your inventory and place your cursor over the effect to get more information about what it does. The information below is the same as what's available in-game, except for some smaller tips.\n\nBreaking the blocks that make up a shrine is likely to ruin the shrine, if you want to create a build around a shrine I'd suggest experimenting in creative first. You can spawn in the shrines with the /place command, type in \"/place trolldom:\" and you should be able to figure out the rest from the autocomplete suggestions.\n\n \n\n## Fire\n![Fire shrine charging up](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu9PQOOc/images/cfc7109ad6079c0739a28806e3a92a169c373239.gif)\n\nFire shrines can be found in the nether, they appear as spires that span the full height between the floor and the ceiling of the nether. The shrines can generate anywhere but will likely be easier to find in large open areas.\n\nTo gain the fire boon the player needs to find the center of the spire, there should be a gap in the central pillar surrounded by four braziers in each of the cardinal directions. Place and light flammable blocks in each of the braziers, coal blocks or something that burns for a longer duration are preferable. Bring some extra flammable blocks in case a brazier burns out before the ritual finishes, if all braziers burn out before the ritual is complete it will reset and one must start over.\n\nThe fire boon grants +30% attack speed and mining speed for 30 seconds whenever a nearby entity takes fire damage. Holds up to 7 charges, hitting an entity or breaking a block removes a charge.\n\n \n\n## Earth\n![Player meditating at an earth shrine](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu9PQOOc/images/0c90754b6c08cb0d1919dfc79350a2923f32146f.gif)\n\nEarth shrines can be found in the overworld, at the intersection of the deepslate and stone strata. The shrines are typically riddled with ore, but mining the ore is likely to ruin the shrine.\n\nTo gain the earth boon the player needs to meditate (crouch + stand still) on top of the central chunk of the shrine for a few seconds.\n\nThe earth boon grants a 4 point absorption shield, the shield replenishes after 10 seconds of not taking damage.\n\nNote: This will likely be expanded upon later to allow the player to draw power from different types of stone while having the boon.\n\n \n\n## Water\n![Player swimming through the first gate of a water shrine](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu9PQOOc/images/54d00fd833e655cbe6da818d8a77f683de1a3cd3.gif)\n\n\nWater shrines can be found in deep oceans, each shrine consists of five gates laid out in a path.\n\nTo gain the water boon the player needs to swim through all five gates in under a minute.\n\nThe water boon grants +0.05 attack damage and -0.5% mining speed when attacking an entity, or the reverse when breaking blocks (triggers every 10th block). This effect stacks up to 60 times in either direction.\n\n \n\n## Air\n![Player looking at an air shrine](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu9PQOOc/images/aefaa550e6aa7df04ae7c15e1dc10122f8267ef3.gif)\n\nAir shrines can be found in mountains, badlands, hills, savannas and plains. A strong wind blows over the shrine, look at the banners around the shrine to discern the wind's direction. With proper positioning and view angle the player can ride the draft into the air or greatly propel themselves forward with an elytra.\n\nTo gain the air boon the player must ride the draft for six seconds without landing, although quickly pushing oneself off the ground after landing might slip the notice of the wind sprites.\n\nThe air boon grants +15% movement speed and the player can press ctrl + space to grant themselves the draft effect in the closest cardinal direction for a few seconds.\n\n \n\n## Licensing & use\nFeel free to use this in modpacks or compilations as long as it's distributed through modrinth.\n\n \n\n## Discord\nI've got a discord server over here: https://discord.gg/MyjK4Fx, jump on if you have questions, need some help or to get sneak-peeks at upcoming features.\n\n \n\n## Support and Contributions\nThis is a pretty new mod and I'd be super happy if you could try your best to break it as much as you possibly can and submit bug reports using the issue tracker link in the nav above.\n\n\nI develop and maintain my mods in my spare time, if you enjoy what you've seen so far and want to help me to create more experiences please consider supporting me on patreon.\n\n\n","published":"2023-07-03T16:51:41.786889Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:42:37.059023Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":5549,"followers":28,"categories":["magic","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["PlZWqwg4","rh0fSXpx","HrAKzfqQ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu9PQOOc/ecf79b1fedf102aeb8210f2c7f0e6d0a5a24579d.png"},"version":{"id":"HrAKzfqQ","project_id":"gu9PQOOc","author_id":"h5Q3O8aK","featured":false,"name":"trolldom 2.0.1","version_number":"2.0.1","changelog":"__**Fixes:**__\n* fixed client crashing if jumping during server disconnect","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-15T12:42:38.441742Z","downloads":5209,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"feaabf1410b8f7f16253fdc6fca8ae6127379d6c","sha512":"b270e24c994bba856eadcfa44ab982823652bc453c71349078e995dba759d40b4e3ee7686b5f74d97301d8b520258b195e9aa087d26fa56ae8e207266f96728b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gu9PQOOc/versions/HrAKzfqQ/trolldom-1.20.1-2.0.1.jar","filename":"trolldom-1.20.1-2.0.1.jar","primary":true,"size":269222,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"HWHl8Evb","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ICBrGhpj","user":{"id":"h5Q3O8aK","username":"mickelus","name":"Mikael E.

The mod late game should feel like vanilla but with added benefits\n\n> The mod is highly configurable. Just want the hammocks with no sleeping changes? You can do just that!\n<hr>\n\n### 🛏 Night Bags 🛏\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/dee42b5dd4643454e75db0a987a810bb31330bed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"197\">\n\n- A late game item crafted with echo shards and phantom membrane\n- Serves as a temporary bed that does not set your spawn point\n- When used will immediately place the player in sleep mode on the spot\n- Upon waking up they will go back in your inventory. Perfect for camping!\n- Does not prevent Phantom spawn nor provide any benefit\n\n<hr>\n\n### 💤Hammocks💤\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/ce174aba2c57bc4ef7edb6632d848d1510f542c9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"341\" height=\"178\">\n\n- Allow players to rest during the day\n- When laying on one you can swing back and forth by pressing \"a\" or \"d\" movement keys\n- Come in all different colors\n- Can be attached to either 2 fences with 2 blocks in between or in a 3 block space against 2 blocks\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🪳Bedbugs🪳\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/7406d71aaed17430f670c918555400a55bfbc804.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"263\" height=\"184\">\n\n- A disruptive mob that has a rare chance to spawn right after you sleep in a bed on high difficulties\n- Normally they ignore the player and sprint toward any bed close by\n- Once they reach a bed they will burrow in it making it unusable/\"infested\"\n- To solve this you'll have to use a potion of harming on the bed itself\n- Can pass through doors\n- Can also rarely spawn in the wild and will attack players when no beds are in sight\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🏠Home Bed🏠\n\n- Sleeping at least 8 times in the same bed will mark it as your \"home bed\"\n- Once a bed gets marked you'll receive a new effect, Invigorated, upon waking up\n- Invigorating increases xp drop from ores and mobs for a long period of time making it a valuable reward for committing to the same bed\n- Be sure not to break or let your bed be infested as doing so will reset its home bed status\n- Sleeping even more nights on the same bed will increase the Home Bed level even further up to a max of 100\n- Home bed status can be viewed in a newly added icon in the sleep screen\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🌒Nightmares🌒\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tNai0h2Y/images/e0ec71bed38bc049d458bf7249f26d4fb49f3e84.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"260\" height=\"231\">\n\n- You can now lay on a bed or hammock without sleeping. This allows you to move your camera and access your inventory like normal\n- Successuflly sleeping will now have a cooldown. By default this will be 5m but some events, such as sleep encounters or nightmares will inflict much harsher penalties\n- You can view your current cooldown in a newly added status bar right below your crossair when aiming or resting on a bed\n- While sleeping you will see the current time on the left corner of your screen\n- Beds will no longer violently explode when in the nether. They will instead only make a tiny blast. You can also disable the explosion entirely allowing you to sleep there\n\n<hr>\n\n### 🧟Sleep Encounters🧟\n\n- Formerly known as \"bad dreams\" this is an old mechanic that was removed in previous versions of mc\n- When sleeping next to a dark spot you'll have a chance to get woken up by a mob that could have naturally spawned there\n- No longer are you safe to sleep in a dark cave!\n\n<hr>\n\n### 😪Sleep Benefits & Requirements😪\n\nThe mod offers many ways to customize your sleeping experience. Here are all the options that it offers with their default behavior\n\n- Sleeping requires full hunger (default off)\n- Sleeping requires an xp toll (default 0)\n- Sleeping will grant a status effect (Invigorating only for home beds as explained above)\n- Heal when woken up (default on)\n- Clear all effects when woken up (default on)\n- Consumes hunger when woken up (default on)\n\nAll these can be turned on or off individually for each bed type (bed, hammocks and sleeping bags)\n\nThe rest of the mod is equally configurable so be sure to check the configs for a more in depth explanation\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>\n\n## 💜Mod Integration💜\n</center>\n\nWhen Heartstones mod is installed sleeping next to a Heartstone owner will grant both of you a regeneration effect\n\n<center>\n\n## ❓Q&A❓\n</center>\n\nQ: This mod seems tedious. I just want hammocks and my op beds back\n> A: Just turn off all the difficulty features in the configs. The mod is entirely customizable\n\nQ: How do i get rid of bed bugs?\n> A: You'll have to account for that, hunting for them when you wake up if you hear one. Smart house construction can also help\n\nQ: I dont like X feature, how do i change it?\n> A: Everything is extremely customizable in the mods configs. Infact mod also contains some optional features off by default\n\nQ: Does this work for multiplayer?\n> A: Yes! Some features like nightmares will account for all the players nightmare change and a \"nightmare night\" will be rolled accordingly. Only the player that actually got a nightmare will be set on cooldown\n\nQ: Why does this mod nerf bed in early game?\n> A: Because being able to skip the only part of a day where mobs spawn above ground without consequences in a game built around surviving mobs seems pretty op to me. In vanilla sleeping becomes such a no brainer that you have no incentive in not doing it as soon as you can every night.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time.

This is noticeable on multiplayer, with some amount of latency;\n\n### Translations\n- Added a line for the Rotten Tomato entity in most langs (thanks, leagris!);\n- Added:\n  - sv_SE (thanks, Bjorkan!);\n- Updated:\n  - es_MX (thanks, CerealConJugo!);\n  - fr_FR (thanks, leagris!);\n  - ja_JP (thanks, EndilCrafter!)\n  - ru_RU (thanks, VGamerGroup!);\n  - uk_UA (thanks, unroman!);\n  - zh_CN (thanks, NumberSir);\n  - zh_TW (thanks, Lobster0228!);","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-22T02:29:40.176044Z","downloads":547923,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bd025d539511beddd6826896604d2aae17b035fd7ae03c4ae659be3df802f4190b91f935b32a07a69842ad98f79bfbdcc3ef6d0e1e540b35989a806c655b4168","sha1":"71daa55fd88b6f181c51ec6892600415df591f64"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/versions/AxgOboGq/FarmersDelight-1.20.1-1.2.4.jar","filename":"FarmersDelight-1.20.1-1.2.4.jar","primary":true,"size":2915349,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"gg7pp5NT","user":{"id":"btHGOarG","username":"vectorwing","name":"Lucas Barcellos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5566692?v=4","bio":"Heyo!

This mod was created as an expansion for the [First-Person Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/first-person-model), but works completely on its own and is fully vanilla/3rd party server compatible(since it's all just visual).\n\n### All features can be enabled/disabled individually in an ingame config screen!

usable, but won't hurt outside of that, can be modified in the config file to extend to more items)\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/compass.PNG)\n\n- Ladder/climbing

ANNOUCNMENT\nPlease report any bugs: [Github Issues](https://github.com/wVibzz/ImmersiveWinds/issues)\n### Update Soon\n- Improved config functionality\n- Different wind levels based on dimensions\n- Maybe Custom Wind Particles\n- [Bug fix] Mod only creates config file if ModMenu is installed\n\n### More wind physics\nUpdrafts from heat source blocks, lower air will tend to rise and then \"cool off\"\nThis adds in to the nether, as there will be lower wind speeds but more rise and lowering of the air inside.\n\n\n\n# Features:\n\n- Dynamic Particle Movement: Experience particles such as smoke, flames, and even snowflakes react realistically to the wind's direction and intensity. Watch as smoke billows and snowflakes drift with the breeze, adding depth and atmosphere to your surroundings.\n  \n- Enhanced Weather Integration: Integrate wind effects seamlessly with existing weather systems.

Not only does it completely overhaul the boring old Minecraft stronghold structure with tons of heavily detailed rooms to explore, but it integrates Supplementaries/Quark decorations and Create mod doors, puzzles, traps, and more. It is the biggest generated structure dungeon you have ever explored, it takes up the maximum size possible in Minecraft. Additionally, it greatly expands upon the lore of the stronghold in Minecraft through lore books found in chests. I got sick of installing structure mods into a pack and roaming the world, only to find vanilla items and nothing of difficulty anywhere. I love detailed builds and Create machines, so I decided to make mods that adds exactly what I’ve been missing. Beautiful and challenging dungeons and structures packed with lore that are fully integrated into multiple core mods.\n\n\nIt is compatible with other stronghold mods (such as Yung's Better Strongholds) but it is HIGHLY recommended you only use this mod to preserve the integrated feeling and original intent.\n\n\nI HIGHLY RECCOMEND USING ONE OR ALL OF THE OPTIONAL DATAPACKS TO ADD UNIQUE MOBS AND COMBAT\n\n[Trailer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUFqx_kgi1c)\n\nConfiguration and optional Integration:\n\nTo enable optional integration, download these datapacks\n\nEnd Remastered\nAlex's Mobs\nThe Graveyard\nDungeons Mobs\nIf there is a mobs mod you want integrated, let me know!\n \n\nTo configure anything else, download this datapack\n\nTo change the spawn rate, change the spacing and separation in the structures set file. Spacing is the Average distance between two neighboring generation attempts. Value between 0 and 4096\nSeparation is the Minimum distance in chunks between two neighboring attempts. Value between 0 and 4096. Can't be bigger than spacing\nTo edit biomes, edit the biome files in tags/worldgen/biome/has structure\nTo change what mobs spawn throughout the structure, edit the integrated_structure_spawners files. Adding mobs to these is fairy straightforward, take a look at one of the optional datapacks if you need an example\n \n\nNote: To use datapacks on a server, I recommend using a global datapack mod or KubeJS\n\n \n\nFeatures:\n\nOver 50 unique heavily detailed dungeon rooms making the experience different every time:\n\n-  Unique small and detailed rooms including study rooms, kitchens, armories, mines, and more\n\n-  Massive rooms to explore and uncover the secrets of including the portal room, grand library, dining hall, and more\n\n-  Medium sized rooms such as prisons, fountains, enchanting rooms, portal rooms, and more\n\n-  Tons of variations of trapped hallways to keep you on your toes\n\n-  2 Custom made music discs by Cama to breath life into the stronghold. One can be found be crafting disc fragments found in the stronghold.\n\n-  Lore books hidden in chests expanded upon the Minecraft lore greatly and giving the stronghold a true backstory and purpose in your world, while still leaving room for the player to piece together it's history.\n\n-  Customized loot, weapons, and tools matching the lore books.\n\n-  Create mod puzzles and traps to navigate\n\n- Join my discord to make suggestions and influence my future projects!\n\n \n\nIf you have trouble finding the stronghold, use Eye of Enders to locate it or use \"/locate integrated_stronghold:stronghold\"\n\n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQ: What biome mods are compatible?\n\nA: Most biome mods are compatible including Terralith, BOP, and BYG.\n\n \n\nQ: Why are there so many dependencies?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n\nQ: Will you backport/update to ___?\n\nA: I will always keep the mod up to date with the newest versions of Minecraft as the dependencies update. I am also currently working on the port to fabric\n\n \n\nQ: Does this mod work with other structures mods?\n\nA: Yes all of Yung's mods, Repurposed Structures and more will all work but it is HIGHLY recommended you only use this Stronghold overhaul mod. YUNG's Stronghold is good but the detail and integration put into this mod makes it miles more immersive and a better experience overall without question in my opinion. If you don't believe me try it out for yourself!\n\n \n\nQ: Can I use this mod in a modpack?\n\nA: Yes! I would love it if this mod gets used in packs.\n\n \n\nQ: Can this mod be only on the server-side?\nA: No, due to its custom music discs and soundtrack\n\n \n\nQ: What features from Quark can be disabled? \n\nA: All of the technical changes and Redstone can be disabled without problem. IDAS uses all the building blocks though.\n\n \n\nSpecial thanks to:\n\nMy Patrons!!!\n\nHowester1984 who helped me build the stronghold!\n\nCama, the author of the incredible music disc you find in the mod\n\nThe Bisect Hosting team and especially Perz for making the logo for this mod!\n\nMegRae, I used her tutorial to build the hanging dragon chandelier in the portal room.\n\nTelepathicGrunt, the author of Repurposed Structures. I used the files from their mod a ton for coding references.\n\nYUNGNICKYOUNG for his jigsaw manager.\n\nMy cat Fonzy for sitting on my lap while I coded this entire thing. Having weights on your lap really helps you stay focused\n\n \n\nJoin the Discord by clicking on the image or link below if you run into an issue of any kind or have a suggestion, I'll try my best to respond to everyone and would absolutely love suggestions!

We want to introduce new players to atlas, and make it easier to maintain and improve.<br/>\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the old `antiqueatlas` ID, and is API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas).<br/>\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.<br/>\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save/API/network/respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\n\nOnce stable and feature-complete, we intend to maintain atlas on most modpack versions >=1.18.2 ([more info](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues/81))\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/credits.txt) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n\n---\n\n<center>\n<b>Tinkerer's:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt\">Quilt</a> - <a

Its main features are:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lPE3bSGgok\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Sleds\n- Sleds are new way to get around Snow. Differently from Boats they curve around the terrain they encounter making them able to smoothly climb up and down slopes.\n- When going downhill they will also accelerate further making ski courses possible.\n- Sleds have improved mobility on Ice and while being able to slide on Snow are still able to steer and you can even bring them to a full stop by rotating the sled by 90 degrees, as you would in real life!\n- Chests can be placed on them to give some inventory space. Also works with Shulker Boxes and Sacks from Supplementaries.\n- You can also attach a tamed Wolf with a Lead to it. When Sleds are pulled by Wolves they will have increase mobility, speed and will be able to climb up with minimal deceleration.\n- Igloos can now spawn with an additional Sled with Chest in front that can contain some sweet winter loot.\n- Sleds can be further customized by placing Carpets on top of them. Doing so will additionally prevent freezing when sledding on top of frigid Powdered Snow.\n\n### Villagers AI\n\n- During winter time villagers will occasionally place down Wreaths on their house doors. They can only place one each and don't worry, they will clean them up when winter is over. Wreath placing can happen during idle time so at around 0 for example.\n- If you have Supplementaries installed villagers will also place down Present blocks containing some cool items. They will only be able to place one Present each and will do so during their meet time (after 9000) around their meeting point.\n- Baby villagers from Taiga and Tundra will throw Snowballs at any entity they see during their play time.\n- \"Winter Time\" is a period of time which can be configured with the provided configs and by default goes from the 20th of December to the 30th of January.\n- If you have Serene Seasons installed you can also make the mod follow its seasons instead.\n\n### Winter themed blocks\n\n- Ginger: a new crop that can be crafted into Gingerbread Blocks, a new decorative block. Wild Ginger can be found in Sparse Jungle biomes.\n- Gumdrops: they come in all colors and can be pushed by entities acting as a mix between a Button and a Pressure Plate that works on all directions.\n- Candy Cane: a sweet looking item, literally. Can be crafted in decorative Candy Cane Blocks.\n- Wreaths: can be placed on doors to bring some Christmasy joy to your house. Works with all modded doors as well.\n- Glow Lights: an item that can be placed on any Leaves to give it some glow in the dark action. Can be removed with Shears or broken.\n- Snow Globe: a block that will change to its snowy state when placed in places where it can snow.\n- New music disc: a new winter themed music disc has been added and can be rarely found in Presents and Igloo Sled Chests.\n\n> This project was made during WinterJam 2021\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

rebirth into beauty on Citadel Station.\" -System Shock 2\n\n \n\nCitadel is a Library mod required for advanced animations and entity properties in 1.14 and beyond. Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation. This is useful when used with the many mob mods that require Citadel, as without changing this they can make it quite difficult to find vanilla mobs.\n\n \n\nDevelopers who want to use Citadel can read [the guide on how to add it to their development environment](https://github.com/Alex-the-666/Citadel/wiki/Getting-Started).","published":"2023-11-03T16:25:45.246822Z","updated":"2024-08-15T22:11:16.840675Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":793742,"followers":134,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["AhrngqR9","l54hCYzm","jWcSsP5K","LOHm0ffg","ge8ra0kG","u3vg28FG","AEa5lIzx","l1j29UHl","1xvYIdqx","aOl88G8l","k2akMR9x","Xdw9cSFG","rmDI9Owy","H2MVcwUf","3OJWvUG9","ssXkoBKk","lAATACbp","zVGb8jz5","mL5pYWWo"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/dea486e5291c6f8ca8813a22e1fa32fa14a4a47f.png"},"version":{"id":"mL5pYWWo","project_id":"jJfV67b1","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Citadel 2.6.0","version_number":"2.6.0","changelog":"-Removed ReplaceBiomeEvent functionality, should drastically improve chunk generation speeds\n\n-Fixed priority of \"space station\" render","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-15T22:11:17.678312Z","downloads":8930,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8edb2264317e547230960109aaadae36ce0db9abb27748d47033c64c7f4958a970172ae382552c5e3c41a4885e95437328a6eba53226fd64c4ce0b4f0ec22b4f","sha1":"fed1e7cb25232d31aaebe86f4ebafe8d9b663387"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jJfV67b1/versions/mL5pYWWo/citadel-2.6.0-1.20.1.jar","filename":"citadel-2.6.0-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":3173174,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rByA3asR","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"citadel-2.6.0-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\embeddium-0.3.30+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"a517e71f6a174e02de2acc635017b8f69e015c26bd6c68b9598923ce25f19e862d78e08d61609ac243bcdb44d3e2c586e84ad8a19694e5391793514df3e47d3f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"sk9rgfiA","slug":"embeddium","project_type":"mod","team":"4VBpO7y2","title":"Embeddium","description":"A FOSS client performance mod for Minecraft prioritizing reliability & mod compatibility","body":"# Embeddium\n\nEmbeddium is a free and open-source performance mod for Minecraft clients.

Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their Discord. I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods.\n\n## Highlights\n\n* All performance improvements from Sodium 0.5.8 and earlier, i.e. a rewritten terrain renderer, various optimizations to the immediate-mode rendering pipeline (used by entities, GUIs, block entities, etc.), and other miscellaneous improvements\n* Available for Minecraft Forge on 1.20.1 and older, Fabric on 1.20.1-1.20.6, and NeoForge on 1.20.1 and newer\n* Integrated Fabric Rendering API support (Indium is no longer required, and will not work with Embeddium)\n* Frequent patch updates to fix mod compatibility issues soon after being reported & reproduced\n* Additional APIs for mod integration\n* Optional support for translucency sorting (can be enabled in Video Settings)\n\n## For developers\n\nIf you're looking to add Embeddium to your development environment, please take a look at the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/For-Developers) for instructions & recommended guidelines for integration.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n* @CelestialAbyss and @input-Here for making the new logo design\n\n## License\n\nEmbeddium is distributed under the Lesser GNU General Public License version 3.

\n\nAlex’s Caves is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that adds 5 new cave biomes to the Overworld. Unlike most normal biomes, these cave biomes are exceedingly rare - yet they all contain a variety of unique blocks, items, mobs and mechanics that makes them considerable subterranean destinations. These five biomes are the Magnetic Caves, the Primordial Caves, the Toxic Caves, the Abyssal Chasm and the Forlorn Hollows. \n\n \n\nTo find any of these cave biomes, you’ll need to discover an Underground Cabin anywhere in the overworld. From there, you will find loot barrels with cave tablets and a Cave Compendium - a guide book for Alex’s Caves that should provide you with all the knowledge needed to find and explore any biome added by the mod. For more information on getting started, see the ‘[Getting Started](https://alexscaves.wiki.gg/wiki/Guides/Getting_Started)’ section on the mod’s wiki.\n\n \n\nAlex’s Caves is a very large mod with a great deal of effort put into the look and feel of each new biome. Each biome added may have its own ambient particles, fog, brightness, light color and more. Because of this, it is recommended to experience this mod without shaders, since many shaders can alter or worsen the unique appearance of several of the biomes. The mod also has built-in compatibility with Just Enough Items and Alex’s Mobs.\n\n \n\nAny additional questions can be answered on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/alexsmods), and bugs can be reported on [Github](https://github.com/AlexModGuy/AlexsCaves).\n\n \n\n### Credits:\n\n#### Creators:\n- Alexthe668: programmer and co-creator\n- Noonyeyz: artist and co-creator\n\n#### Sound Team:\n- PrismaticPinky: sound design\n- LudoCrypt: musician\n- Gatetoh: musician and sound design\n- Arby698: sound design\n- RenRen: musician\n- _Ninni: sound design\n\n#### Documentation Team:\n - HolidayRaptor: documentation\n- PlummetStudios: documentation\n","published":"2023-11-04T17:47:20.616416Z","updated":"2024-08-15T22:34:57.855947Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":335844,"followers":669,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["equipment","food","game-mechanics","magic","technology","transportation"],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["VOMqwoQ3","JnyjMWKA","zUdjxO9k","gCvzvSsJ","e7H7vKvS","SLvvjh2O","RplA7oyA","3yOJpMFg","pdifL7d0","2gc9us5X"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U6GY0xp0/4165eef78a7efa0f5acda964dd094c08ee0e5680.png"},"version":{"id":"2gc9us5X","project_id":"U6GY0xp0","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Alex's Caves 1.1.5","version_number":"1.1.5","changelog":"-Vastly improved world generation speeds\n\n-Fixed typo in cave compendium\n\n-Fixed ores missing block tags\n\n-Fixed guano blocks not dropping anything when mined\n\n-Fixed vesper overspawning\n\n-Fixed underground cabins loading in neighboring chunks\n\n-Fixed galena gauntlet destroying shulker box items\n\n-Fixed extinction spear not cooking mob drops\n\n-Fixed suffocation inside ancient leaves\n\n-Fixed sea staff friendly fire against owner\n\n-Fixed magnetic quarry ignoring unbreakable block tags\n\n-Fixed dinosaurs not laying eggs\n\n-Fixed luxtructosaurus block drop chance not being configurable\n\n-Fixed tripodfish suffocation bug\n\n-Updated Japanese translations\n\n-Updated Korean translations\n\n-Updated Toki Pona translations\n\n-Updated Russian translations","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-15T22:35:00.695339Z","downloads":4678,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4c2b044111727354ca4968243b871686aaff9c63","sha512":"9a364512a0fa97b28620d068349119703e6cb0eef5e0d0281d92adf1fd017441de0117a445be18af0f4a54895e343cabd0dc4b0916b2d952d092ffe861ba2bac"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U6GY0xp0/versions/2gc9us5X/alexscaves-1.1.5.jar","filename":"alexscaves-1.1.5.jar","primary":true,"size":61610911,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"jJfV67b1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ri6vA5Gk","user":{"id":"KJbDpjKi","username":"Noonyeyz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42457241?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-05-06T12:46:00.258719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"ri6vA5Gk","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"alexscaves-1.1.5.jar"},"mods\\ResourcePackOverrides-v8.0.3-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"a1e21b52a11611fbcbbe7e5fd1227e264f9285d1443945aa422c28e9a84caf400a8533e2b85f6c4bd26800e249c4958289ec796b4a3f6c41335adc39c933155f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YsFycamt","slug":"resource-pack-overrides","project_type":"mod","team":"g4J9iAcM","title":"Resource Pack Overrides","description":"Ensures important resource packs stay always active and helps clean up the pack selection screen.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/resourcepackoverrides/banner.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/resourcepackoverrides/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

do.\n\nI've created a video explaining how to customize Scriptor in-depth.\nCheck it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLaZzCKMcQA).\n\nWelcome to Scriptor, the mod which gives words power.\nThis Vanilla-style mod adds various kinds of magic spell to the world\nwith the aim of making discovery and spellcrafting simple, interesting,\nand reasonable when compared to Vanilla gear and capabilities.\n\nIn this mod, spells are constructed much like sentences, with a catch:\n\n**The words and sentence structure used are random in every world!**\n\nFor the average player, plenty of spells can be obtained in each world,\nbut for anyone dedicated enough, you can reverse engineer these spells\nand learn how to draft even more powerful spells yourself.\n\nFor information on usage and such, check out the docs on \n[GitHub](https://github.com/ssblur/scriptor/blob/main/doc/README.md)\nor explore the world in game to learn more about how magic works for\nyou.\n\n## Special

I got sick of installing structure mods into a pack and roaming the world, only to find vanilla items and nothing of difficulty anywhere. I love detailed builds and Create machines, so I decided to make a mod that adds exactly what I’ve been missing. Beautiful and challenging dungeons and structures packed with lore that are fully integrated into multiple core forge mods.\n \n\nIf you’re new to this mod I highly recommend locating a Labyrinth, Tinker’s Workshop, Ancient Mines or a Pillager Fortress and playing through it. Those took by FAR the most time to build and I believe they are genuinely very fun and rewarding. Good luck!\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n    This version of the mod is not complete. There are a ton of planned features and the structure's code and looks will be tuned up over time. It also probably has some bugs. Report them in the built in issue tracker or let me know on discord!\n\nFeatures\n\nOver 50 unique heavily detailed structures in the Overworld and Nether dimensions including:\n\n-  20 unique small and detailed world building structures such as campsites, markets, animal dens, and more\n\n-  5 Endgame level dungeons ranging from expansive dwarven mines to the desert Labyrinth to the Pillager Fortress\n\n-  Create themed Dungeons with spinning death traps such as the Tinker's Workshop\n\n-  15 unique houses and inns for weary travelers\n\n - 6 magical wizard and enchanting towers to explore\n\n-  Sunken pirate ships\n\n-  Villager Castles\n\n-  Magic towers and portals to explore in the nether\n\n-  Event based structures such as the Winter Wagon and Haunted Manor\n\n \n\nPlanned Features:\n\n \n\n- Underground dungeon variants\n\n- More Nether and End structures\n\n- Join my discord to make suggestions and vote on what structures get added next!\n\n \n\nIf you have trouble finding one of these structures, just start typing `/locate idas` into the chat and you should find a list of all the structures. For example, typing `/locate idas:castle` will find the closest Castle to your location.\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: What biome mods are compatible?\n\nA: Most biome mods are compatible including Terralith, BOP, and BYG.\n\n\nQ: Why are there so many dependencies?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n\nQ: Will you backport/update to ___?\n\nA: I will always keep the mod up to date with the newest versions of Minecraft as the dependencies update\n\n\nQ: Does this mod work with other structures mods?\n\nA: Yes all of Yung's mods, Repurposed Structures and more will all work with zero issue. \n\n\nQ: Can I use this mod in a modpack?\n\nA: Yes! I would love it if this mod gets used in packs.\n\n \nQ: Can this mod be only on the server-side?\nA: No, due to its custom music discs and soundtrack, and changes to client side structure blocks\n\n\nQ: For everyone who wants to live in the structures: How do I get mobs to stop spawning?\n\nA: Try using the Magnum Torch Mod\n\n \nQ: What features from Quark can be disabled? \n\nA: All of the technical changes and Redstone can be disabled without problem. IDAS uses all the building blocks though.\n\n \nQ: What mobs from Alex's Mobs are used? \n\nA: IDAS uses a lot of the mobs including Skelewag, Murmur, Cave Centipede, Rocky Roller, Dropbear, Bear, Crocodile, Crimson Mosquito, Frilled Shark, Snapping Turtle, Flutter, Bison, Underminer\n\n\nI’ve spent over 300 hours building and coding this mod.

Here is a quick look through the changes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhauled the music sheet GUI. Now it is a horizontal, scrolling sheet.</li>\n<li>You can now create <strong>MUCH longer</strong> music sheets. The upper limit is long enough to fit basically any music in a single sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>Note length</strong> is customizable! You can drag the mouse to set the length of each note.</li>\n<li>Multiple notes can be put at the same beat, and notes of different lengths can <strong>overlap</strong> in any way possible!</li>\n<li>TWICE the number of octaves. So, we are up from 4 to <strong>8 octaves</strong>. Note that not every instrument is suitable for every octave.</li>\n<li>Music sheets have a <strong>volume</strong> setting now.</li>\n<li>Each individual note also has a <strong>volume</strong> that can be set.</li>\n<li>Much more<strong> granular Tempo options</strong>, with an upper limit of 3000 BPM!</li>\n<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>new instruments</strong>: Redstone Guitar, Bass Guitar, Oboe and French Horn</li>\n<li>Advanced instrument playing GUI: You can now press <strong>multiple notes together</strong>, and <strong>releasing a key stops the note</strong>.</li>\n<li>Support for <strong>MIDI device input</strong> in the instrument GUI! Just connect your device and right click an instrument as normal.</li>\n<li>With 1.17.1-2.2, you can also use your MIDI device in the music sheet GUI as well! You can even record with it!</li>\n<li>The new record button in 1.17.1-2.2 allows you to<strong> record music in real time</strong> with your keyboard or a MIDI device.</li>\n<li>Middle clicking a note in the sheet GUI lets you view its <strong>real life notation</strong> name and edit it.</li>\n<li>Customizable <strong>measure lines</strong> in the music sheet GUI, for visual aid.</li>\n<li><strong>CTRL+Z to undo</strong> in the sheet GUI.</li>\n<li>A <strong>help button</strong> in the sheet GUI that explains the controls and keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li>Storage and network for the music sheets are handled more smartly now, consuming <strong>less resources</strong> than before, regardless of the length of a music.</li>\n<li>Loading an old world will <strong>automatically update</strong> all old music sheets to the new format on load. This is <strong>irreversible, </strong>so backup your world if you might want to play in an older version of the mod.</li>\n<li>Old copied musics can still be pasted in the new version (but not vice versa).</li>\n<li>Old exported sheet files can be imported in the new version (but not vice versa).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Note: </strong></span>If updating from an older version, I suggest you backup your world (or at least just the music sheets) before updating, in case there is a problem with the update process.</p>\n<hr /><hr />\n<h2>Features (before the huge update)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Music sheets that let you create music</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Sounds follow the chromatic scale with 12 notes per octave and&nbsp;4 octaves for a total of 48 notes</li>\n<li>&nbsp;11 different tempo settings from 60 BPM to 1200 BPM</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Writing music with the mouse or the keyboard, whichever you find comfortable</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Convenient keyboard functionality such as space, delete, backspace</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Selecting, copying and pasting notes. CTRL + A, CTRL + C, CTRL + V shortcuts work.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Copying between different sheets and even outside Minecraft. You can copy them to a text file to back up or paste in another world/server.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Putting up to 5 sheets in the hotbar to see and preview multiple layers of music at the same time when editing. Neighboring sheets can easily be disabled with a button that appears.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Previewing sheets with an instrument in the off hand. You can also lock the instrument per sheet to only preview with that instrument even when your off hand item changes. This can be used to mark which instrument a sheet is supposed to be played with and is also useful with neighboring sheets previews.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;13 craftable instruments and 1 instrument that can be found in certain treasures.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Using an instrument by itself plays a random note.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Using an instrument while holding a sheet with your offhand plays the sheet to the world.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Music boxes take in a sheet and an instrument. They start (or stop if playing already) playing when they take in a redstone signal that goes from off to on.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Music boxes also send a one second redstone pulse to their right face when they finish playing. This can be used to chain songs or activate piece of a contraption.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Metronomes supply a steady ticking when the redstone signal is on. The ticking rate can be set with a right click or using a music sheet on the metronome.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;After four tickings of a metronome, all nearby players that hold a music sheet with the correct tempo and an instrument will start playing synchronously. Use this to play songs together with your band.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Keyboard usage is as shown:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VvVz169/music-mod-keyboard.png\" alt=\"Keyboard Bindings\" width=\"480\" height=\"188\" />&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<h4><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/09rkM0z/music-recipes.png\" width=\"730\" height=\"818\" /></h4>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>LuchadorMickey</strong> for most of the graphics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>inuyasha01</strong> for the Chinese translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Greyberet</strong> for the Spanish translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Ste B </strong>for the Italian translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <span class=\"opened-by\"><strong>whiteevilbro</strong></span> for the Russian translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>Szpieg2000</strong> for the Polish translation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Credits to <strong>FoxMcloud5655</strong> for back-porting changes to 1.16.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<div style=\"all: initial !important;\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"all: initial !important;\">&nbsp;</div>","published":"2023-02-05T14:15:40.306769Z","updated":"2024-08-03T10:37:49.032445Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":95114,"followers":136,"categories":["decoration","game-mechanics","social"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["5xGpUT3o","VFv617TS","c62RBvbc","v4i8vz6N","vFsY5EDb","He8qxPaP","sH524ipB","1eMIAl3g","6WneoHVZ","Uu63sYWg","XT3XLTcW","Mt13SJH7","y5ILp4Ep","HshJamuy","E5VM3nf1","Kzq2EOKC","atsAXaFx","WeiESc7B","9ceNeRjO","vAdwlMhE","GAtc1v9U","lns17YWi","L9GiipeN","vkIE67gD","uzfwjdqC","cpviesaT","NbN5jg50","HL8oJCAk","fCGt6FzT","X8IxTwa9","M4AfyD8G","dJl8IbKS","eeLBdNBF","QM70Gb46"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qQpWCN75/5651c74521ed00c9d586f81f81cdecb099307291.png"},"version":{"id":"eeLBdNBF","project_id":"qQpWCN75","author_id":"tIBCPzSw","featured":true,"name":"Music Maker Mod 1.20.1-1.0.2","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.2","changelog":"Fixed a crash with remaining block instrument music spirits, added sanitization to the import function, fixed some message translation keys getting mixed up","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-03T09:03:32.137308Z","downloads":510,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"716f95c5974d946fc482f54ffa2938082cab9267","sha512":"a93b4febc4b3c914a1dccf4be7b55b133b8d5cc6d825288dd40ffe95774eb297a000bae1ad46839623efea14ed787c2fb3c61dabd4bab7ef9a4d0b7da068d909"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qQpWCN75/versions/eeLBdNBF/xercamusic-1.20.1-1.0.2.jar","filename":"xercamusic-1.20.1-1.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":7714018,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hz9BWPt7","user":{"id":"tIBCPzSw","username":"xerca","name":"Ercan Serteli","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/tIBCPzSw/507e904157c293f848387514cb7c2217204c086b.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-05T13:02:41.579541Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"xercamusic-1.20.1-1.0.2.jar"},"mods\\createaddition-1.20.1-1.2.4d.jar":{"sha512":"2958f434b67daf03665e35101ca5b08104daba0087e2be5175deebac24b08357321b796aafe4c62324f989c1ab4dba25984e864a595ba6d0fcc922adafac5a3f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kU1G12Nn","slug":"createaddition","project_type":"mod","team":"gi4UGsOA","title":"Create Crafts & Additions","description":"Create Crafts & Additions extends Create and acts as a bridge between electricity and kinetic energy","body":"# Create Crafts & Additions\n### For Minecraft Forge 1.15.2, 1.16.4/5, 1.17.1, 1.18.1/2, 1.19.2, and 1.20.1\nThanks to community contributions, now also for Fabric 1.18.2, and 1.19.2\nWarning!

A Trials Chamber could have anywhere from 6 additional Chambers to 20+ base on generation, and these Trials Chambers spawn anywhere undergroud in the Overworld starting at Deepslate level.\n\nTrial Spawners & Trial Vaults work as intended, with the Spawners being randomly picked based on the room type from a selection of options, and can be optionally increased in difficulty by using the Bad Omen effect. Vaults will pick between 3 to 6 rewards from a loot table, with the key items being new cosmeitcs & the Heavy Core, which can be used to craft the Mace weapon, as expected.\n\nOn top of the new Trial related stuff, all new Tuff & Copper variations are actually craftable, with one new addition which is simply put a Polished Tuff variation of the Copper Bulb which is crafted first but can be turned into Copper Bulbs by adding copper ingots to them afterwards. Also, additional changes has been made, such as Raid Captains dropping Ominous Bottles, and no longer granting Bad Omen directly, brand new potion effects, and more.\n\nNote: Any versions of this mod below v2.0.0 is from the old concept of \"Trials Towers\", which is a similar backport mod but made little battle towers instead of massive Trials Chambers, and also very outdated selection of blocks, and code, in comparison to v2.0.0.","published":"2024-05-02T03:49:47.339368Z","updated":"2024-08-04T05:03:08.144431Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":3280,"followers":26,"categories":["adventure","equipment","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["jI6ZnZEr","DcTE9x0V","iTesDfAd","Xdsw4mrD","81iFAMQz","TqgW25CV","ROauU8Rx","5tqp1pfm","l3xlm1ve","EWNpz5cU","gBetm0eq","FmUC9jAz","OQFcwMKW","YlmbZUF7","FGSF1xc8","T3eI22il","csiWDFIF","omc3X6LW","g8AZfNK7","b5zLjMGM","mGSXXMJn","OZ9M4MHq","JhzXe5Nq","1NmEt4K1","ry2kCvGx"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/s5Igmyc6/015c9ec8f06cc197bbb6b0b8bc1a6c5f8c4ad3bf.png"},"version":{"id":"ry2kCvGx","project_id":"s5Igmyc6","author_id":"1EVQAWmC","featured":false,"name":"Trials Chambers [Backport] V2.1.10","version_number":"2.1.10","changelog":"* Quick Hotfix.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-04T05:03:08.922462Z","downloads":694,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1137cd352732b5c8e72907fa71f44ca476bbdbf1","sha512":"1ea86455e44fc967ef4887049fa282aa364356aa8f34fc596a2ae914998ad4e3ba928d1cdc009550ca481a24f986b956a63ca9eefd066630ee2b5ba3fd30f1d1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/s5Igmyc6/versions/ry2kCvGx/Trials-2.1.10.jar","filename":"Trials-2.1.10.jar","primary":true,"size":8344798,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BOCJKD49","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nOUYhAZV","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"HQzrghVw","user":{"id":"1EVQAWmC","username":"Jusey1","name":"Salju","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61861078?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-02T05:37:37.985305Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Trials-2.1.10.jar"},"mods\\letsdo-brewery-forge-1.1.9.jar":{"sha512":"a567acd7a5991ed6c6fa58a205cca81d230c21fd9d9ad553aa6d17f29e5a2d012d386cd541dd65b5585c025c14e5686a9a871761b85082131fadef6f8705c626","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"cV5LQXKx","slug":"lets-do-brewery","project_type":"mod","team":"9phzS9d1","title":"Legacy: [Let's Do] Brewery","description":"Ozapft is!

Lederhosen, shirts, Dirndl\n* New Building Blocks, new Food Blocks, new decorative Elements - All in the Style of the Oktoberfest\n<br>\n… and more\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n\n__Getting started__\n<br>\n<br>\n__Drying__\nOne of the basic ingredients for beer and whiskey is dried corn, wheat, or barley. To obtain this, you need a drying silo. Gather the corn, wheat, or barley, open the hatch of the silo with a skillful left-click (you need both hands for this! So make sure they are both empty!) and throw it into the silo. The silo connects in a 2x2 or 3x3 grid and can be extended up to a maximum height of 9. The larger the silo, the greater the capacity and the faster the drying\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing__\nGreat job with the drying! Next up is the Brewing Station. To start the brewing process, you still need more ingredients. In most cases, hops, water, and coal. What? Coal in beer? No, no - it serves a different purpose. Let's take a normal wheat beer as an example: Throw two sacks of dried wheat and some hops into the brew kettle, fill it with water, and you're almost there. You've probably already noticed that the brew kettle is a bit larger and consists of several parts - now go to the part with the stove and fire it up with the coal. That's it!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing Process__\nThe brewing process lasts several seconds and requires your attention. Several small events occur at different parts of the Brewing Station, such as:\nThe furnace loses heat and requires more coal\nThe brewing kettle overheats; remove some water\n... and more to figure out \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas. Yes - even in those from [insert any Worldgen Mod that uses the #is_taiga tag here]. To grow hops, you need a somewhat elaborate construction: Build two fence posts with a height of three blocks (or more - higher is always better!) and connect them with a rope. Then you can plant the hops at the lowest point of the rope on farmland. Of course, you can also use the ropes for other things: fences, railings - let your creativity run wild! :)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas.

The armor pieces are sold by villagers. You can either find them at the Brew Festival or you can provide them with a Bar Counter to work at. One part of the armor set cannot be purchased and must be obtained in another way - but I'll leave it to you to figure that out.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFeeling lost?

default. Fluffy dandelions spawn gently bobbing seed particles when not in rain. Any entities moving through fluffy dandelions (projectiles, players, mobs) spawn greater concentrations of particles.\n\nUsing bone meal on a dandelion will cause it to grow into its fluffy variant. Pollinated bees can also turn dandelions fluffy, at the same rate as other pollinated crops.\n\nFluffy dandelions are somewhat delicate, so they can only be collected using shears (dropping a normal dandelion otherwise).\n\n## Config\n\nYou can alter the following:\n- A multiplier for general dandelion particle density (default: **1.0**)\n- A multiplier for dandelion particle lifespan (default: **1.0**)\n\n### Biome Tag\nUsing a datapack, players can alter one of two tags which indicate the biomes in which the two types of fluffy dandelion patches spawn:\n- `just_dandy:has_fluffy_dandelion` includes plains and forests. Normal-sized patches.\n- `just_dandy:has_frequent_fluffy_dandelion` includes meadows, and has patches of fluffy dandelions spawn with greater frequency and in greater density.\n- `just_dandy:has_thick_dandelion` has very frequent dandelion patches, and exclusively includes Dandelion Fields from the mod [World of Wonder](https://modrinth.com/mod/world-of-wonder).\n\n---\n\n**Requires [Blueprint](https://modrinth.com/mod/blueprint).** Includes optional compatibility with many different mods;

output fluid by giving the fluid the ` createdieselgenerators:pumpjack_output `\nBiomes can be denied from having oil by the ` createdieselgenerators:deny_oil_biomes ` tag or have an increased amount of oil by the `createdieselgenerators:oil_biomes` tag.\nThere is even more stuff to configure in the config of this mod.\n\n#### Join our discord server!\nhttps://discord.gg/pUgaSXcGEQ\n\n####

📘About:\nSully’s Mod started out a few years ago when I decided to try and make a mod. I couldn’t think of a name and called it the first name that came to my head as a placeholder “Sully”, the name stuck and now people think my name is actually Sully. <br/> \nBack then it was made with MCreator and combined with the fact that I back then didn’t have a good understanding of vanilla feel, it became more limited each version. I decided to completely revamp the mod, completely dumping the MCreator version and getting a coding team (Uraneptus and MiteBeMana). <br/>\nWith each feature I try to think it out as well as I can, making sure the feature is well-balanced, feels fun to play with and overall just feels like something new. It tries it’s best to feel like a Minecraft update full of random features. The mod is planned to have features for every player, explorers, builders and redstone engineers.\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## 📝Current Features:\n\n**[Disclaimer the mod is currently in it's beta so many features are not yet implemented, check out this doc if you want to know more about the planned features: [Planned](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0-PYvZDjAtcMZySJMDEGL2xQSIM8Znr9rzibRzqDeA/edit?usp=drivesdk)]**\n\n**• Jade**\n\n**• Jade Flinger Totem**\n\n**• Jade Shield**\n\n**• Jade Horse Armor**\n\n**• Copper Buttons**\n\n**• Laternfish**\n\n**• Tortoise**\n\n**• Tortoise Shell**\n\n**• Bouldering Zombie**\n\n**• Jungle Spider**\n\n\n_If you want to know more about the indiviudal features, check our wiki out: [Sully's Mod Wiki](https://github.com/Uraneptus/Sullys-Mod/wiki)_\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## 💼 Dev team:\n\n**Sully:** _Art, Animations, Game Design, Sound Design_ \\[[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ModSully)]\n\n**Uraneptus:** _Code, Additional Sound Design, Mod Icon/Banner, Documentation_ [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/uraneptus2)]\n\n**MiteBeMana:** _Code, Additional Game Design_ [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MiteBeMana)]\n\n**KekeCreations:** Code [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CreationsKeke)]\n\n**A full list of all Contributors can be found here:** [Credits Page](https://github.com/Uraneptus/Sullys-Mod/wiki/Credits)\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/fN4UrzH.png)\n\n## 📋FAQ:\n\n**\"What is planned for the remake?\"**\n- Here is a doc with all of the planned concepts that are done: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0-PYvZDjAtcMZySJMDEGL2xQSIM8Znr9rzibRzqDeA/edit?usp=drivesdk) <br/>\nThere is more to come though!\n\n**\"Why are you remaking the mod?\"**\n- Check this twitter thread out: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ModSully/status/1483351756033732611)\n\n**\"For which minecraft version will the mod be remade?\"**\n- 1.18+.

teas and coffee.\n\n## Flavors\nCurrently, there are 4 flavors:\n\n- Green Tea: provides the new Vitality effect, grants player resistance for Wither effect and increases player's healing amount by 50% per level.\n- Yellow Tea: provides the new Tenacity effect, increases player's Armor Toughness.\n- Black Tea: provides the new Maturity effect, increases eaten foods' nutrition.\n- Coffee: provides the Caffeinated effect from Farmer's Respite, increases player's speed and attack speed, resets player's time since last sleep.\n\n## Foods\nRespiteful added cakes for the tea flavors (Coffee Cake already exists in Farmer's Respite),\nand as a substitution for Neapolitan's milkshakes, all 4 flavors has their Snow Top Tea/Coffee：\n\n- Snow Top Green Tea: strengthens all beneficial effects by 1 level and reduces their duration in half.\n- Snow Top Yellow Tea: weakens all harmful effects by 1 level and extends their duration in twice.\n- Snow Top Black Tea: weakens all beneficial effects by 1 level and extends their duration in twice.\n- Snow Top Coffee: strengthens all harmful effects by 1 level and reduces their duration in half.\n\nNote that there are configurable restrictions for effects to be transformed.\nBy default, effects must have at least 20 seconds duration to be strengthened,and will only be extended to 27:18(32766 ticks) in maximum.\n\nRespiteful also adds new drinks using Neapolitan flavor ingredients:\n\n- Mint Green Tea: Mint + Green Tea\n- Vanilla Milk Tea: Vanilla + Yellow Tea + Milk\n- Adzuki Milk Tea: Adzuki + Black Tea + Milk\n- Mocha Coffee: Chocolate + Coffee + Milk\n\n## Changes for Farmer's Respite\nFor consistency and QoL, Respiteful has done some configurable changes for Farmer's Respite:\n\n- Replacing all related foods' effects with the new flavor effects.\n- Made all drinks can be drunk even when player is full.\n- Bring the updated Caffeinated effect back to

The restore defaults button allows for resetting a single config file as a whole (you can tell a config has been modified when it's name is in italics). There is also a button for opening the actual config file in an editor. The copy to defaults button allows you to set this config as a default config to be used whenever the config is recreated (mainly useful for server configs when creating new worlds).</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/956/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">When a config is open, you'll find a big list with all config options and categories. The button to the right of every option will restore it's default value. When an option is hovered, a tooltip will provide additional information, including the internal key, description, range, allowed values, and the default value. On the bottom, the cancel button can be used for discarding changes, the done button will save all changes to the config file.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/950/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The path bar on top shows where you currently are within the active config file. But there's more: It also functions as a navigation bar. You can click on previous categories to go back to them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/951/2021-11-03_21.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Searching is quite fancy, the current query is highlighted, and found entries are sorted accordingly. Results will be located in the current, as well as all subsequent categories. And best of all, the search field can be cleared again with a simple left-click.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/405/952/2021-10-05_16.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Editing more complex values such as strings, enums and lists is done via a separate screen.

All values are entered as strings and will be converted and checked automatically. Sometimes, the type of a list cannot be determined by Config Menus for Forge, so you'll be promted to choose the type yourself, or edit the option directly in the config file instead (not yet implemented).

The only limitations are that you need to be an operator on that server, and Config Menus for Forge needs to be installed server-side as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can't edit Forge's client config!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> You have OptiFine installed, Forge's client config can't be used then. This has nothing to do with Config Menus for Forge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a server owner and I don't want anyone to edit the server's configs while it is running.</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Simply don't install Config Menus for Forge on your server, everything but editing server configs will still work for your players.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a mod developer and I already added custom backgrounds for Configured. Do I need to do it for this mod again?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No, Config Menus for Forge uses the resources provided by mods for Configured as well. There are other developer options planned for the future though. In case you're unsure about adding a custom background to the config menus for your mod, check out the instructions on the mod page for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configured\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Configured</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm a developer and I want my mod to use these config menus. What do I need to do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Nothing really. Just ask your users to install this mod alongside yours. You don't need to add a dependency or anything like that.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M1Yd5EZ.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>🏆

This mod fixes that by making PI/180 a stored value that isn't calculated multiple times for each entity, using variables instead of repeated calculations, and more. This, when applied to all entities, does indeed speed up performance, whether it be a small bit or a noticeable bit, depending on the surrounding entities and your PC.","published":"2022-07-28T02:09:34.583501Z","updated":"2023-05-13T03:38:44.767420Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1407712,"followers":616,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["nxnZwtrr","wpjsvepd","yvAsQAfN","dDeGyaOG","mYGanPjG","u2P8WuwJ","lrnG23SV","kipvKTOY","9zQlAOJO","uJqPZ41e","dXcNDUia","FBISH1pC","LCHmWNvu","uralQ5Oz","xxuvnms3","5lHXCowj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/yHf7SALy/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"5lHXCowj","project_id":"yHf7SALy","author_id":"2TIVL5E6","featured":true,"name":"1.6 (1.20)","version_number":"1.6-1.20","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-13T03:38:46.076762Z","downloads":1204473,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6e4dca503f0952e18c07175d2281c8f2a2d8227939457646a8de0ce1ac72cf83861667f45e91c703629e1a9594c28ccc93cd3a74641ecf885fbcce5d10e13338","sha1":"0e611399323878b9f3efcc6016ea5d6eefc8c765"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/yHf7SALy/versions/5lHXCowj/lunade-fastanim-1.6-1.20.jar","filename":"lunade-fastanim-1.6-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":118384,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"y41rtLTY","user":{"id":"2TIVL5E6","username":"Lunade_","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87103914?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-25T21:32:15.110086Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lunade-fastanim-1.6-1.20.jar"},"mods\\tetra-1.20.1-6.4.0.jar":{"sha512":"3248acf644f8f9a4d6b4abdc13a4399d6e7c8136b17e68a284e09cc95b040dc6a1149f7117620de46c88b6b7af0c1b4a81ff0c67542c8fb1f40dd7e17aa91ac6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YP9DjOvN","slug":"tetra","project_type":"mod","team":"rwyLCVex","title":"tetra","description":"Modular tools, weapons and equipment.

Craft a mallet using two sticks and two planks\n2. Craft and place a vanilla crafting table\n3. Right click the table with the mallet to upgrade it into a workbench\n4. Craft a vanilla weapon, tool shield or a bow and place it in the workbench\n\nCheck the advancements window to learn how to progress further\n\n## Configuration\nContent can be added, changed or removed from tetra using datapacks, go here for more information: https://github.com/mickelus/tetra/wiki/\n\n## Mod compatibility\nTetra supports usage of a few materials added by other mods, since tetra uses item tags (or the ore dictionary before 1.14) it's difficult to say exactly which mods are supported. Enchantments from several mods are also supported from 1.14 and forward. Check out the compat listing for mods and datapacks that integrate or extend tetra \nThe following non-vanilla materials are supported in 1.16:\n\nSpoiler (click to show)\nAny mod that adds one of those and tags them correctly would make them available for use in tetra.

Designed for better user experience and API.\n\nJade can be installed only on the client side. But many features require Jade on the server side. (item storage, horse stats, bees in beehive...)\n\n**For mod integration, try Jade Addons: [Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-forge)  [Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-fabric)**\n\n### Keys (default):\n\n - Keypad 0: Open configuration screen\n - Keypad 1: Toggle overlay\n - Keypad 2: Toggle liquid display\n - Keypad 3: Show recipes (Requires JEI)\n - Keypad 4: Show uses (Requires JEI)\n - Keypad 5: Narrate target\n\n### Notable changes compared to Hwyla:\n\n - API re-design\n - More vanilla addons\n - Higher configurability\n - Better accessibility\n\n[![Interested in supporting me and the development of mods?

 <summary>Text version if the thread design does not render</summary>\n\n  ## What is Almost Unified?\n  \n  The mod is inspired by the idea of UniDict. An old, no longer maintained mod from the days of 1.12.2.\n  \n  Old versions of Minecraft used a system called the Ore Dictionary. Its purpose was to make the life of modders easier when adding new resources that might exist in other mods already. When used correctly, you could use resources from various mods in their recipes interchangeably. However, if you ever played a big modpack back in the days, you probably know that there were like 10 different ingots for each material because of many mods adding them.\n  \n  This often resulted in a lack of storage space because all these resources from the different mods didn't stack. Additionally, some mods didn't use the dictionary correctly for their recipes so a lot of the resources were useless.\n  \n  UniDict solved this issue by unifying the same resources from different mods so only one item for each resource was left and could be used for all recipes. So instead of having 10 different copper ingots, you will only have one which acts as the dominant universal copper ingot.\n  \n  A lot of time has passed since 1.12.2 and the Ore Dictionary is long gone. In today's modded Minecraft, there is the tag system which acts quite similar to the Ore Dictionary. Still, they also don't solve the problem of many similar resources from different mods.\n  \n  **Almost Unified** tries to solve this by working in a similar fashion as UniDict did.<br>\n  Its goal is to have one dominant resource for each configured tag and make all recipes use this dominant entry.\n  \n  ## How does that work?\n  \n  By defining a priority mod list and target tags in the config, Almost Unified tries to find a dominant item for each entry and changes the recipes depending on that.\n  \n  In modern Minecraft, recipes are usually made of JSONs and are loaded when joining a world. Each loaded recipe is read by the mod and altered depending on different properties inside the JSON.\n  \n  For all inputs, the unification process tries to use the designated tag so all items will remain useful which means Almost Unified should also work in existing worlds.<br>\n  For outputs, Almost Unified will use the dominant item.\n  \n  Since the modification happens before the recipe is loaded by the game, there are no demanding processes going on while the game is running.\n  \n  ## What features does Almost Unified have?\n  \n  The mod transforms existing recipes to have a unified resource list that players and packmakers can work with. It doesn't add its own recipes, resources, ore generation or similar content.\n  \n  Because there is a chance to have duplicate recipes when unifying, Almost Unified will take care of duplications and remove them.<br>\n  Additionally, it hides all non-dominant entries from JEI/REI automatically.\n  \n  The mod is fully reloadable. Configs are loaded every time the unification process starts which means they can be edited on the fly. To restart the process, just rejoin the world or use the `/reload` command.\n  \n  ## Can you give an example?\n  \n  Think about having two mods (modA and modB) that both add Silver Ore. Additionally, they both add Silver Ingots and respective recipes to obtain the ingot such as blasting or smelting the ore.\n  \n  If one of those recipes doesn't accept a tag as input, Almost Unify will change that. Furthermore, it will pick one of the Silver Ingots as the dominant item depending on the mod priority list inside the `unify.json` config. The dominant Silver Ingot will then be used as output for all recipes no matter the mod.\n  \n  After the unification process, you will end up with some equal recipes. Almost Unified will merge them and change their namespace so it's visible that the recipe was changed. In the end, you will have recipes that accept tags as inputs and only the dominant item as output. Duplicate recipes are gone.\n  \n  ## More Information\n  \n  For more information like limitations, native integrations or the FAQ, check out the

Developers\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0\n-->\n\n# ![CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/logo.png)\nCC: Tweaked is a mod for Minecraft which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game. A fork of the much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of new features.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> I'm not sure what that is [...] I don't know where that came from.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, December 2020](https://youtu.be/D8Ue9I-SKeM?t=980)\n\n> It is basically ComputerCraft. It has the turtles, and the computers, and writing Lua programs and all that stuff.\n>\n> \\- [direwolf20, May 2022](https://youtu.be/7Ruq33XmQIQ?t=537)\n\n\n## Features\nControlled using the [Lua programming language][lua], CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start\nwriting code and automating your Minecraft world.\n\n![A ComputerCraft terminal open and ready to be programmed.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/basic-terminal.png)\n\nWhile computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. *Turtles* are the\nsolution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](https://ccf.squiddev.cc/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\n## Community\nIf you need help getting started with CC: Tweaked, want to show off your latest project, or just want to chat about\nComputerCraft, do check out our [GitHub discussions page][GitHub discussions]! There's also a fairly populated,\nalbeit quiet IRC channel on [EsperNet], if that's more your cup of tea. You can join `#computercraft` through your\ndesktop client, or online using [KiwiIRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

If you are a mod developer however, and you would like to use Lexiconfig in your own projects, scroll further to the Development section.\n\nIt currently does not have support for other configuration libraries, but as I continue to update it, I will add more compatibilities to each one to ensure that it does not conflict with others and can instead seamlessly integrate between them.\n\nHere is a list of current as well as planned integrations across different config libraries/api:\n\n❌ - Unintegrated\n✅ - Integrated\n❓ - In Progress\n|    Status     |    Mod    |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| ❌ | Cloth Config |\n| ❌ | oωo config |\n| ❌ | Configured |\n\n## Development\nThis mod contains an api that can be used to shelve new lexicons, listen to events, etc.\n\n### Depending\n\nbuild.gradle\n```\ndependencies {\n  implementation \"com.codinglitch.vibrativevoice:vibrativevoice-api:API_VERSION_HERE\"\n}\n```\nYou can go to [https://versions.codinglitch.com](https://versions.codinglitch.com) to view the latest api version.\n\n### Usage\nTo shelve your own lexicons, you first have to your own Library. This can be done by simply creating a new class extending the Library class, and annotating it with the LexiconLibrary annotation.\n```java\n@LexiconLibrary\npublic class MyNewLibrary extends Library {\n  @Override\n  public void shelveLexicons() {\n      \n  }\n}\n```\nIn a Forge setup, no further changes need to be made. However, if you are developing for Fabric, you will have to add this class as an entrypoint in your fabric.mod.json.\n\nfabric.mod.json\n```json\n//...\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"lexiconfig\": [\n    \"com.path.to.MyNewLibrary\"\n  ]\n}\n//...\n```\n\nThe next step is to finally create and shelve your lexicons. You can do this by simply creating another class for the lexicon, and providing it with the proper annotations, like as follows:\n```java\n@Lexicon(name = MY_LEXICON_TITLE) // preferably use your mod id as a name\npublic class MyLexicon extends LexiconData {\n  @LexiconEntry(comment = \"This is a comment for a simple field!\")\n  public String mySimpleField = \"content\";\n\n  @LexiconPage(comment = \"This is a fancy new comment on the fancy new category!\")\n  public MyNewPage myNewPage = new MyNewPage();\n\n  public static class MyNewPage extends LexiconPageData {\n    @LexiconEntry(comment = \"This field is inside a lexicon page!\")\n    public Boolean myPageField = true;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe next and last step is to shelve the lexicon, which can be done by simply adding an instance of it as a field in the library and shelving it in the given method.\n```java\n@LexiconLibrary\npublic class MyNewLibrary extends Library {\n  public static MyLexicon MY_LEXICON = new MyLexicon();\n  \n  @Override\n  public void shelveLexicons() {\n    LexiconfigApi.shelveLexicon(MY_LEXICON);\n  }\n}\n```","published":"2024-05-15T10:56:17.221456Z","updated":"2024-06-16T08:07:49.013451Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":17376,"followers":2,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["EnogjSzv","ZA74pTKr","jz1FyL2K","4eExsjf7","lWgEgKf4","kFOuIh1H","Gy7U48aH","WIvmlVHV","f1O7hWf1","lwVdnWWV","pwTdTEQD","PwdyJM6K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/D157Rgyf/6ba6d9da939f40b83e76cce0d7b665230f69f644.png"},"version":{"id":"lwVdnWWV","project_id":"D157Rgyf","author_id":"FYi7FIzM","featured":false,"name":"[FORGE] Lexiconfig 1.3.11","version_number":"1.3.11","changelog":"- Massive API changes\n- Expanded usable event types\n- Allowed for configuration reloading through /reload","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-16T08:07:38.392550Z","downloads":5947,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b43672fda8de755cd822d3c4cc9a67f65a9ea5d1","sha512":"72bf0cd184114af4fa8a650d784b29c78a7e7fee628193e90e500fa215ee1f7cf437844d1749214bb671678b5e850f1ad276ac82731b9b224a07c157fdb86960"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/D157Rgyf/versions/lwVdnWWV/Lexiconfig-forge-1.3.11.jar","filename":"Lexiconfig-forge-1.3.11.jar","primary":true,"size":38240,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"d29a869d3c81ac26ea1cd2feeb2427a78c750cd2c734204621ba5538a82492e61040918fd4b2ec0ac427020596ad429a85c82de8ccda48b62552f55b9b9f61e9","sha1":"636e4c8ecbd60f05457b677b34fe193dcf486a44"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/D157Rgyf/versions/lwVdnWWV/Lexiconfig-forge-1.3.11-javadoc.jar","filename":"Lexiconfig-forge-1.3.11-javadoc.jar","primary":false,"size":191654,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"4145abfa204fa052c19b60121989eb10fc3fb285c305cddc40dd8b98953d3e09808c4f84b215e500f2728699b3905fb5fd46dc18028475e8d457512847cd5920","sha1":"d81c6e535ea9746de66190e04224b7407191beaa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/D157Rgyf/versions/lwVdnWWV/Lexiconfig-forge-1.3.11-sources.jar","filename":"Lexiconfig-forge-1.3.11-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":28138,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.19","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DrIN4cZS","user":{"id":"FYi7FIzM","username":"CodinGlitch","name":"CodinGlitch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22829873?v=4","bio":"i code","created":"2023-04-16T23:32:22.660525Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Lexiconfig-forge-1.3.11.jar"},"mods\\watut-forge-1.20.1-1.1.3.jar":{"sha512":"43ea1e4472f0963f768f0ddb1d8be523dc7e0fdc265029d3cc2b8df4a3d7a88ab7dcf1e053ee7813c40f97dd5dfe5afc6ad48276fb390b07a66b959b20488c25","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AtB5mHky","slug":"what-are-they-up-to","project_type":"mod","team":"A84mUMft","title":"What Are They Up To (Watut)","description":"Lets you see if players are typing, in a GUI, idle, with cool ingame visuals","body":"# Features:\n\n\n## See when they're typing, in world and in GUI, the visual gets faster and wackier the faster you type!:\n\n![typing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corosauce/WATUT/43929914de316ac05ed1844927a83db457633ad4/showcase/typing.gif) ![typing_gui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corosauce/WATUT/43929914de316ac05ed1844927a83db457633ad4/showcase/typing_gui.gif)\n\n\n\n## See when they're In a GUI such as inventory, chest, crafting, etc, shows their hand moving and clicking around at a screen in front of them\n\n![in_inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corosauce/WATUT/43929914de316ac05ed1844927a83db457633ad4/showcase/in_inventory.gif)\n\n## See when they're Idle for over 5 minutes.

As it has some client features, but also server ones.\n\nCan work server-side only, but JEI/REI/EMI and creative tab removals won't work.\n\n \n\n- **What if I mispell an item ID in the config file?**\n\nNothing will happen. Adding invalid ID's won't cause issues, but obviously the item won't be blacklisted as it technically doesn't exist. Same thing would happen if the mod isn't present, but it will be if it's added later and the ID is valid.\n\n\n\n## Example Configuration:\n\n\nConfiguration is as simple as adding JSON entries for each item you want to obliterate.\n\nItems can be from vanilla or any mod, you just have to add the id with the proper namespace, like minecraft:golden_apple\n\nIt's located inside the config folder, with the file \"item_obliterator.json5\" (>=2.0.0) or \"item_obliterator.json\" (< 2.0.0)\n\n![Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050578253489917992/1197387350930620456/image.png)","published":"2023-04-27T01:18:17.693047Z","updated":"2024-06-27T22:48:26.093505Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":292041,"followers":141,"categories":["management"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","optimization","utility"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["wStgh7KF","Z7O1PDF6","DhBs53zu","apfGL9jJ","TF654Ypi","hvb70HnH","pdDz3IHw","OgSArgH9","C1RqeDeY","9VoRHOKh","AttOhwKN","3Da2NymJ","PPE0fiKq","YOjk8208","XEnZel0q","pJbzX1XF","HBSgjdKo","1FeDblKK","7wB98NiB","IfKpXjEk","jN8eVPiJ","QsH3oZB7","OqMP9ZL0","veDPhmBN","tl9Z9uga","EV0cDZhI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3ESR84kR/1da8db99e7f41f033f9d1437c50d42646b2aff7b.png"},"version":{"id":"EV0cDZhI","project_id":"3ESR84kR","author_id":"Kp5oK4eX","featured":false,"name":"Item

[Original mod here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mindful-eating).\n\nMindful Eating is a mod that attempts to encourage diversity of diet without negatively affecting player experience. It aims to achieve this in a few ways.\n\nDiet's API is used to detect what food group the last food eaten belongs to, and reducing exhaustion (loss of saturation/hunger) by 75% from an activity tied to that group - meaning that the same amount of food will take 4 times as long to use up, when doing a valid activity (such as running, mining, healing etc). This can be switched back to Diet's regular mechanics, and the percentage of exhaustion reduced can be configured. The relationships between food group and exhaustion source can also be configured, but the default values are:\n\n- Fruit - swimming\n- Vegetables - sprinting and jumping\n- Grains - mining\n- Proteins - fighting\n- Sugars - healing and the hunger effect\n\nThis mechanic is communicated through the changing of the hunger bar icons, which will now reflect the group of the last food that you ate. When you are doing an activity with reduced exhaustion, a bounce will pass along your hunger bar icons. This is compatible with Appleskin's visual changes to the hunger bar.","published":"2024-04-07T00:17:47.979852Z","updated":"2024-05-30T01:10:38.367371Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":438,"followers":11,"categories":["food","game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["HPyVGr2a","rJa3zEAj","BvAMVUiF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R1cPLs6u/7bf83dfba468c2b2fcc5895abf45981fb366e923.png"},"version":{"id":"BvAMVUiF","project_id":"R1cPLs6u","author_id":"DqS3asFR","featured":false,"name":"Mindful Eating - Fabric 1.1.1","version_number":"1.1.1","changelog":"-Fixed a crash occuring if the game could somehow not perceive steak ","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-30T01:10:38.865127Z","downloads":275,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4b289ef8cfea4e7677eaed79db8a50d1ba94ad98","sha512":"100c359ef9d068a3125c247a5a1ce3f68ec9ef617ea0a2f30d36c3add2dcd5da07ab085c21822f61f7ff5364b8ffea71e73eb3e7aa4935e6651682c673bd0761"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R1cPLs6u/versions/BvAMVUiF/mindful_eating-1.1.1.jar","filename":"mindful_eating-1.1.1.jar","primary":true,"size":49136,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"SsIkH9rZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ohNO6lps","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GD3026cu","user":{"id":"DqS3asFR","username":"GoopSwagger","name":"Lucifixion","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83467229?v=4","bio":"the undefeated champion of mario vs luigi","created":"2021-05-05T19:50:34.809020Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"mindful_eating-1.1.1.jar"},"mods\\miners_delight-1.20.1-1.2.3.jar":{"sha512":"4d459153ab93a4536b75bfd566b0915cceb7953347d05c0cb5fe129360e5d49d64731528ccd63ff5e785091e9f6300db0bcf5778f51ca82a8f5584fba9278f60","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qMxbM4BQ","slug":"miners-delight","project_type":"mod","team":"7ZZCdpT5","title":"Miner's Delight","description":"Farmer's Delight add-on for miners","body":"<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734514387498565673/1187234714629718086/MD.png?ex=6596257d&amp;is=6583b07d&amp;hm=8c825798024375c99e5087a96202cfe8e7b0fe27fc604c51bab765163504f3e9&amp;\" alt=\"\" width=\"508\" height=\"120\" />&nbsp;<br /></span></p>\n<p><strong><b>📖 </b><b>About</b><b>:</b></strong><b><br /></b><strong><b>Miner's delight</b></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an addon for</span><strong><span style=\"color: #993300;\"> <a style=\"color: #993300;\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Farmer's Delight</span></a></span></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that adds culinary content </span><b>focused on Caves</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including a new and </span><b>mysterious <strong>meat-flavored</strong> crop</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that grows in caves!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiment with new and unique ingredients to prepare delicious or unusual meals to </span><strong><b>share with your friends!!</b></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Addon Mod for Farmer's Delight focuses on making <strong>gastronomic </strong></span><strong><b>content more accessible to mining!!!</b></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><strong><b>📦 Beta Version</b></strong><b><br /><br /></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This mod is currently </span><b>under development</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so issues and instabilities may occur.

src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2.8.0/assets/cozy/social/discord-singular_vector.svg\">](https://discord.gg/etTDQAVSgt)\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/master/images/icon.png\" align=\"right\" width=\"128px\"/>\n\nThis client side mod allows you to paste special characters into the chat, on signs, books, and in the anvil text box.\nIt also has support for a customizable symbol and kaomoji list.\nAdditionally, you can select a unicode font that is supported by minecraft,\nand your typed text will automatically get converted into the supported characters.\nAll symbols are unifont symbols supported by minecraft, meaning all other players can see them without needing the mod on their client or the server.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nThe symbol panel can be accessed by clicking the small button on the bottom left, available in several screens:\n\n* Chat screen\n* Anvil screen\n* Sign edit screen\n* Book editing screen\n\n![Symbol menu](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/raw/master/images/symbol_menu.png)\n\nWhen opened, on the top there are multiple tabs in which all symbols are grouped.\nClicking on a symbol in a tab will paste it into your chat box.\nThe first tab shows all available symbols of the following tabs and additionally has a search bar for finding a specific symbol.\n\n![All symbols](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/raw/master/images/symbol_list.gif)\n\nThe next tabs group the symbols into various categories:\n\n* Faces & People\n* Nature & Food\n* Things\n* Activities, Transport & Places\n* Symbols\n* Shapes\n\nThe tab labeled `^-^` contains various kaomojis like `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`.\n\nThe last tab is a favorites tab, which you can add favorite symbols too as well as adding custom symbols.\nTo favorite a symbol, just right click it in the symbol panel.\nSymbols can be un-favorited by just right-clicking it again.\n\n## Symbol suggestions\n\nFor inserting symbols faster, you can use the symbol suggestion popup, which works similar to other chat platforms.\nBy typing a colon (`:`), a popup will open and shows symbols that match with what you type after.\nFor example, if you type `:cro` it will suggest a crown, crocodile, croissant, cross and crossed flags.\n\n![Symbol menu](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/raw/master/images/suggestion.png)\n\nIf you just enter a colon without entering anything after, it will show the first couple favorited symbols for quick access.\n\n\n## Fonts\n\nOn the top right of supported screens, you can choose between many different fonts.\nYou can select a font on the dropdown on the top right.\nThis will change the text you type to that font.\nFonts make use of unicode characters to produce a more interesting looking text.\nThese are also supported on clients without symbol-chat and can be seen by everyone.\n\n![Fonts](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/raw/master/images/fonts.png)\n\n## Config\n\nSome aspects of this mod are configurable using [Cloth config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) (not required).\nThe configuration screen is accessible through the gear button on the top of the chat screen, as well as the [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) config button.\n\nThe config allows you to change the appearance and behavior of the symbol-chat HUD.\nYou can also add custom symbols not present in the tabs by adding them to the \"Favorite symbols\" text box.\nThere is also support for adding custom kaomojis.\n\n![Config](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/raw/master/images/config.png)\n\n## Unicode table\n\nAs an advanced feature, you can access a unicode table through the `⣿⣿` button next to the config buton.\nThis allows you to browse all unicode pages with the minecraft font to find new symbols.\nYou can also search symbols and directly add them to your favorites or copy them to the clipboard.\n\n![Unicode table](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/raw/master/images/unicode.png)\n\n## Fully customizable\n\nThe symbol tabs and the symbol fonts can be fully customized and expanded using resource packs. For more information, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/wiki/Resource-pack-syntax).\n\n## Compatible projects\n\n* The [Pixel Twemoji 9x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pixel-twemoji-9x) and\n[Pixel Twemoji 18x](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pixel-twemoji-18x) resource packs can be used to get nicer looking\nemojis than minecraft's. They also provide a symbol panel layout more suitable for these emojis.","published":"2022-03-25T19:06:01.880837Z","updated":"2024-07-29T15:21:24.424540Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":142555,"followers":310,"categories":["social","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["mTwCeqbM","XroC5UAA","OIo2wwp5","4F2QOMCH","bpWE1way","jl1FZX9a","CzbAVUK4","vzCwq3Bl","3VrSBVqF","phtEfp7K","abGOOicX","ulu7fSoi","kflT2wWm","FABt5DgE","9TPJ3hlD","SxWNqdQd","Lb2qWsGG","dmaMy4mo","vQVSbH6l","Edc4YWuc","blRqful8","Qy1MNWzU","oezVsEcy","HXQwvTDj","5UsDL3cr","iQcnkMgs","vilSeCiM","dcB32SMC","W14hP5NV","rOpMKADU","3B5Ug34e","GfM4mWzG","N5VAtB21","DKgysVgV","XhG7ECKc","q2UvhJAD","oGuRJtP5","qwiLQIGP","lLS3rrTc","y58ucGIR","JgGM0I9d","KXbT0W0U"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NKvLVQMc/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"rOpMKADU","project_id":"NKvLVQMc","author_id":"7zh5pUCQ","featured":false,"name":"1.1.2","version_number":"1.1.2","changelog":"* Fixed focus still going to symbol chat hud elements when using the arrow keys, preventing the chat box to be used ([#39](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/issues/39))","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-10T21:17:30.360734Z","downloads":78522,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"88ebd50f3da273b17e9b9ad04a3ee562fbbdfb70","sha512":"61ddc70ff2ef5a651c0d8aa7d74f2190c61e5a8d607dc837f475f82ae7c3b9d9d66b1630f128f32324e222cedbc77a55fe681d7eb44b276640f85610be0280db"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NKvLVQMc/versions/rOpMKADU/symbol-chat-1.20.1-1.1.2.jar","filename":"symbol-chat-1.20.1-1.1.2.jar","primary":true,"size":178605,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"KlT3UWRE","user":{"id":"7zh5pUCQ","username":"replaceitem","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40722305?v=4","bio":"I'm a passionate fabric mod dev bringing my random ideas to life","created":"2021-11-15T15:10:57.592204Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"symbol-chat-1.20.1-1.1.2.jar"},"mods\\betterlightning-1.0.1-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"467f037df739ab9b5ba1b2bcd1f9b506aa7a110e8e0befdbe7e2822ef9231c55433ca3d9d95ce995f95c45ca382616904299027d7e55b0976f7daa54ddc175da","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"exGIC7QX","slug":"delayed-thunder","project_type":"mod","team":"3usCSac3","title":"Delayed Thunder","description":"A Forge mod adding realistic distance-based thunder delay & custom thunder SFX","body":"This mod adds realistic, immersive thunder sounds that are delayed based on the player's distance from the lightning.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at
