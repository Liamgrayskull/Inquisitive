# TannyJung's Tree Pack

The main tree pack for [Tan's Huge Trees](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tan-huge-trees) mod (only for versions after the "RT World Gen" update). Separated from main mod, contains a lot of generated tree files, their presets and settings.

This new tree pack system designed to be able to update though the internet, means even the mod is no update, the trees can still up to date. As new versions, the trees is generated by my tree generator, so will be a lot of tree files (might be 1,000+ in the future), so I separated them instead of puting inside the mod. Also supported custom tree packs from people who interested, this pack will be an example of how to create. But note that it will not support auto download and install system, as it looks not safe if they put unreliable link to the system or may contain a virus.

Can be auto install though in-game, so it's optional to manual install it. For how to install, read in official website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/tannyjung/minecraft-projects/tans-huge-trees/installation).
