  This file contains the Liquid Regions settings for each dimension.
While the Better Caves carvers are added per-biome, the Liquid Regions
(i.e. the giant water and lava pools at the bottom of the world) are handled
on a per-dimension basis.
The liquidregions.json file is used to define the Liquid Regions for each dimension.
You can add or remove dimensions, or modify the settings for existing dimensions.
If a dimension is not defined in this file, then it will not have any Liquid Regions.
In that case, the normal aquifers will be used instead, as specified in the dimension's
respective noise_settings data pack json.
